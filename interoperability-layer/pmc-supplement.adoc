An alternative method for downloading files from PMC is as follows:

1. download the FTP file oa_file_list.txt 
2. Iterate over the list, filtering out items that have already been downloaded
3. For each item, download the tar.gz file associated with the record
4. Extract the tar.gz file. The compressed file contains: metadata, full text PDF and any other accompanying data. Then,
  ** process and store metadata,
  ** process and store PDF.
5. Continue with the next document.

For updating, one can either:

1. Redownload the FTP file weekly and reprocess (skipping previously downloaded items)
2. Use the API to get a changeset since last download using the OAWS (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/oa-service/) and only download the changes. 

We did not choose this method due to the fact that although the initial download might be faster we would be duplicating our work; we would either have to redownload the file and process it weekly, which would be slower than a changeset, or implement the OAWS method anyway.
