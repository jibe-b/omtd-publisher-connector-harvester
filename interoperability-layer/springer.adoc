=== Publisher APIs
The API provided by springer only allows 5,000 requests / API key / day. The search only allows a maximum of 20 items per request. Also, it is impossible to retrieve the 10,000th page if we were to iterate over a query of * of 20 items / page. Springer reports over 295,000 Open Access items.
