= Accessing content from Publishers - Mechanisms and limitations

== Overview

Purpose of this document is to present harvesting capabilities of major scientific literature publishers via machine protocols and highlight limitations of accessing content in large scale through these interfaces. A possible harvesting approach is presented for each publisher and how each publisher's data can be mapped to https://github.com/openminted/omtd-share_metadata_schema[OpenMinTeD publication schema]. Ultimate goal is to create an  interoperable layer for machine access to OA content from publishers for TDM purposes.

This is an dynamic page, should be updated every time a machine interface of a publisher is altered.
