== Crossref

=== Crossref API
Crossref is not a traditional publisher but the prominent DOI Registration Agency. 

We use the Crossref Metadata API to discover DOIs of published article. This method is used as a generic approach for DOI discovery task in several publishers. 


=== Information provided by the publisher
N/A

=== Aggregation approach
The DOI discovery task can be divided into the following steps:
. Discover member, e.g. discover Springer: ]http://api.crossref.org/members?query=springer  and retrieve prefixes from results message→items[]→prefixes[]
. Retrieve works by that publisher, for example for Springer Nature (prefix:10.1891) http://api.crossref.org/works?filter=prefix:10.1891. 
  .. You can paginate over results by rows and offset parameters: e.g. http://api.crossref.org/works?filter=prefix:10.1891,rows:10,offset:1000.
  .. However if you try to navigate to more than 10k then you encounter the deep paging problem. In such case you can use a cursor to navigate into large result sets, e.g.: 1st request: http://api.crossref.org/works?filter=prefix:10.1891&cursor=* The response gives a next-cursor which, if followed, can retrieve the next page (then retrieve the next cursor to retrieve next page etc.). This is essentially the equivalent of resumptionToken of the OAI-PMH protocol http://api.crossref.org/works?filter=prefix:10.1891&cursor=AoE/CWh0dHA6Ly9keC5kb2kub3JnLzEwLjE4OTEvMDE5OC04Nzk0LjI4LjM=

|Task|Limitation|

|DOI discovery
|CrossRef as the de-facto DOI registration agency naturally imposes no restriction in discovering DOIs, offering quite handful methods to do so (e.g. by member, by native query, by funder) and utilising cursors to address deep-paging issues.

|Incremental update
|Result set from a certain date, or a time window, can be obtained via the from-XXX-date,until-XXX-date. XXX marks different dates in publication record lifecycle and can be deposit-date, index-date, update-date, created date, pub-date

|Imposed limits
|Though not explicitly enforced, CrossRef preserves the right to throttle requests to a limit in order to ensure that the service remains usable. From the website: 'From time to time Crossref needs to impose rate limits to ensure that the free API is usable by all. Any rate limits that are in effect will be advertised in the X-Rate-Limit-Limit and X-Rate-Limit-Interval HTTP headers.'

|Response formats
|Results are returned in JSON format. Though JSON by nature avoids enforcing explicit structure (i.e. is schema free), results are structured in the CrossRef data https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/blob/master/api_format.md[model].

=== Recommendations
We have discovered that for a portion of resources exposed via CrossRef API, the metadata records is not complete. One of the most common fields omitted is the licensing field. We understand though that this relates more to how publishers provide data and is not fully CrossRef’s limitation.
