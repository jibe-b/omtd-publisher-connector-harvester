                <Para>Age was found to be the best correlate of adherence to prescribed treatment. As regards psychological dimension studied, medication adherence was negatively associated with both cognitive and affective psychological reactance; patients with higher psychological reactance were more likely to be noncompliant than patients showing a low level of psychological reactance. Regarding health locus of control, only the external dimension of doctor-attributed health locus of control was positively associated with medications adherence. No effect on adherence was observed for the self-efficacy scale.</Para>

                <Para>Psychological reactance is an important correlate of adherence to treatment in patients with depressive disorders and this needs to be considered when giving clinical advice in order to avoid inducing reactance and thus non-adherence to prescribed treatments.

              <Heading>Background</Heading>
              <Para>Depressive disorders are a major problem for public health because of their very common presentation. They are a major cause of disability and can cause death both by suicide and because of increased rates of physical disorders [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. Until two decades ago, depression was considered an acute and self-limiting episodic illness. However, long-term naturalistic studies have revealed the importance of considering depression as a chronic lifelong disease with different possible clinical courses in which symptom severity transverse judgments provide limited prognostic information. Approximately 70% of patients recover from major depressive episode during the first year [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. However, of those patients who do not recover within the first year, 10% to 15% remain ill for at least five years [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. Of the patients who recover from an episode of major depression, 22% relapse during the first year of monitoring [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. Only 25% of patients experienced a single episode of depression while 75% suffer from a recurring depression, with one or more recurrences throughout life [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. In addition, between one quarter and two-thirds of patients with major depression suffer comorbid dysthymia [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>Non-adherence to antidepressant medications is a significant barrier to the successful treatment of depression in clinical practice, and this has been linked to poor treatment outcomes such as increased risk of relapse and recurrence, in addition to increased healthcare costs [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>]-[<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>After four decades of compliance research, the literature shows that treatment adherence in psychiatric practice is a multifactorial issue that includes patient-centered factors, therapy-related factors, healthcare system factors, clinician-patient alliance and communication factors, social and economic factors, and disease factors [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]-[<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. However, despite the relevance of the contribution of that group of variables in predicting adherence, considerable accounted variance remains. A recent systematic review on compliance with prescribed treatment in patients with depressive disorders has revealed there is no evidence of a substantial relationship between compliance and socio-demographic or clinical variables [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. Under these circumstances, there is an imperative need to identify major determinants of non-adherence, particularly those modifiable and thus amenable to intervention, which could facilitate the optimal use of psychotropic medications.</Para>
              <Para>The adherence construct has been reported as a health-related habit comprised of a set of very different behaviors, which are not always related to each other [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]. The health belief model that postulates that health behaviors are expressions of health beliefs has been proposed to account for non-adherence to prescribed treatments [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>]. Patients' health cognitions should contribute to medication adherence since they reflect patients' beliefs regarding the extent to which they are able to control or influence their health outcomes based on their personal experience, the course of their illnesses and the different treatments used.</Para>
              <Para>Having control, or the belief of having control, over one's health has been hypothesized to moderate personal health-promoting behavior [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>],[<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>] and has been shown to be of importance for the wellbeing, quality of life and functioning of patients with chronic psychiatric disorders [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>]-[<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>]. Nevertheless, few studies are available concerning factors that may influence patients' sense of control and that enable finding strategies in mental health interventions to promote these patients' sense of control and adherence.</Para>
              <Para>The study of psychological reactance, health locus of control and the sense of self-efficacy could be of crucial importance and can help to increase knowledge about patient's adherence to treatment. Psychological reactance is an aversive affective reaction in response to regulations or impositions that impinge on freedom and autonomy [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>],[<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef>], and by means of limiting and threatening freedom, recommendations to follow a medication have the potential to elicit reactance and, as a result, lead patients to ignore the recommended treatment. Health locus of control refers to the individual's beliefs regarding the control of health [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>]. A patient with an internal locus of control believes that health outcomes are a direct result of their own behavior, while a patient with an external locus of control believes that health outcomes are a result of either chance or other powerful people, such as physicians. Finally, sense of self-efficacy reflects the individual's belief in their own skills to plan and perform certain activities to attain particular aims [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>],[<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>] and leads to a greater sense of confidence and control, translating into a greater theoretic likelihood of both intending to perform the behavior and actually doing so.</Para>
              <Para>None of these psychological characteristics―potential determinants of adherence to treatment―have been jointly investigated in depressive disorders. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the individual and joint effects of psychological reactance, health control beliefs, and the sense of self-efficacy on adherence to a treatment regimen among psychiatric outpatients with depression. We expected health locus of control to have a marked effect on adherence to a treatment regimen, such that internally oriented patients would adhere more than externally oriented patients. In the same way, we hypothesized that psychological reactance would also have a marked effect on adherence to a treatment regimen, such that patients with low reactance would comply with their physicians' guidelines and instructions more than patients with high reactance that would oppose them. Finally, we expected self-efficacy to have a considerable effect on adherence to a treatment regimen, such that patients with high self-efficacy would adhere more than patients with low self-efficacy.</Para>

                <Para>From January 2013 to May 2013, one hundred and forty-five consecutive psychiatric outpatients suffering from depressive disorders seen in two Community Mental Health Centers on Tenerife Island (Canary Islands, Spain) were invited to participate in a cross-sectional study; a total of 119 accepted. Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study if they were aged 18 and over and were diagnosed by their psychiatrists with mood disorders using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition (ICD-10) codes F31 (bipolar affective disorder), F32 (depressive episode), F33 (recurrent depressive disorder), and F34.1 (Dysthymia). Inclusion into the study required patients to have received at least one drug prescription. Each participant received a full explanation of the study, after which they signed an informed consent document approved by the clinical research ethics committee of Nuestra Señora de Candelaria Teaching Hospital in Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Each participant then filled out a brief socio-demographic survey and the remaining questionnaires.</Para>

                  <Para>Age, sex, educational level (no formal education, primary studies, secondary studies, and university degree), history as psychiatric patient (in years), and type of psychoactive drugs currently taken were assessed. For assessment purposes the drugs were divided into the common groups of psychotropic drugs: antidepressants (tricyclics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and serotonin and norepinephrine selective reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs]), benzodiazepines, antipsychotics (conventional and atypical) and mood stabilizers. For statistical analysis purposes, a new variable (number of different drugs) was drawn up as an indirect measure of treatment complexity. We also recorded how long patients had been under psychiatric treatment (in months), the number of different psychiatrists treating them during that time, and the number of psychiatric admissions specifying their voluntary or involuntary character. Psychiatrists responsible for patient mental health care were asked about patient diagnosis.</Para>

                <Heading>Self-reported adherence</Heading>
                <Para>Self-reported adherence to psychiatric medication prescribed was assessed using the Morisky scale [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>] in its Spanish correctly validated version [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>], a simple four-item yes/no self-report instrument commonly used to assess patient adherence to treatment across a variety of chronic medical and psychiatric conditions, including affective disorders [<CitationRef CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef>],[<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>]. The Morisky scale includes items querying whether the patient ever forgot to take medications, was careless with medications, stopped taking medications at times when feeling better or discontinued medications when feeling worse. This scale enables classifying patients as compliant or non-compliant. Patients are classified as non-adherent when they answered "yes" to at least one of the four questions. The scale can also be used as a continuous variable, where maximum adherence is defined as answering "no" to every question. The scale has been shown to have good reliability (<Emphasis Type="Italic">α</Emphasis> = .83), and concurrent and predictive validity in outpatient settings [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>],[<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>].</Para>

                  <Para>The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) is a 21-item self-report questionnaire that assesses cognitive, behavioral, affective, and somatic symptoms of depression, developed to correspond to the criteria for DSM-IV depressive diagnoses [<CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>]. Each item is scored by the subject on a four-point scale (0-3) according to the way the participant has been feeling in the previous two weeks. The 21 items are then summed to give a single total score for the BDI-II, for which cutoff scores have previously been established. The cutoffs used differ from the original: 0-13: minimal depression; 14-19: mild depression; 20-28: moderate depression; and 29-63: severe depression. Higher total scores indicate more severe depression-related symptoms. The BDI-II is a reliable and well-validated measure in screening for depression symptoms in adults, with Cronbach's alphas ranging from 0.73 to 0.95. The Spanish validated version by Sanz et al. (2005) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>] was used.</Para>

                <Para>Three questionnaires were used in the study: the Hong Psychological Reactance Scale (HPRS), Form C of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLCS) and the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE).</Para>
                <Para>The Hong Psychological Reactance Scale [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>] is a 14-item self-report questionnaire designed to measure the individual difference in reactance proneness, that is, a person's trait propensity to experience psychological reactance. Psychological Reactance [<CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>] assumes that, when an individual's freedom is threatened, the individual will be motivated to restore the perceived loss of freedom. Participants indicated the extent to which they endorsed each cognitive or affective statement on a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). The study used the validated Spanish version of the scale [<CitationRef CitationID="CR33">33</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>Form C of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) Scale [<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>] was used to assess patients' perception about `who' controls their depression outcomes. MHLC is an 18-item, general purpose, condition-specific locus of control self-report scale that could easily be adapted for use with any medical or health-related condition to assess an individual's belief on what influences their health. It is comprised of four subscales: one internal locus of control subscale: internality and three external locus of control scales: chance, doctors, and other (powerful) people that measure control variables in regard to participants' health. Each item consists of a belief statement about patient medical condition with which they may agree or disagree by means of a six-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>] to strongly agree [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>]. The study used the validated Spanish version of the scale [<CitationRef CitationID="CR35">35</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>The General Perceived Self-Efficacy Scale [<CitationRef CitationID="CR36">36</CitationRef>] is a 10-item self-report scale that measures general self-efficacy as a prospective and operative construct. In contrast to other scales designed to assess optimism, this scale explicitly refers to personal agency, i.e., the belief that one's actions are responsible for successful outcomes. Each item is scored from 1 (not at all true) to 4 (completely true). The summary score ranges from 10 to 40, with the highest score indicating high self-efficacy. The study used the validated Spanish version of the scale [<CitationRef CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef>].</Para>

                <Para>Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were assessed according to descriptive analyses. An initial correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationship between psychological processes and their relationship pattern with traditional contextual variables associated with adherence to treatment. To contrast adherent and non-adherent patients in the different variables, one-factor ANOVA was performed. To predict adherence a logistic regression analysis was performed to introduce both nominal and continuous variables together. In order to test differences in subscale scores, given the different number of items in the MHLC-C and Psychological Reactance subscales, each subscale score was computed as the mean of item scores. Also, in order to contrast the specific role for type of medication used, chi-squared analyses were performed. Statistical analyses were performed using the software package SPSS19.</Para>

              <Para>We recorded a high response rate of 82.1% resulting in a sample of 119 psychiatric outpatients suffering from depressive disorders. Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">1</InternalRef> shows the sample distribution according to socio-demographic and clinical variables included in the study. According to the Morisky scale total scores, slightly more than half the patients (60, 50.4%) were classified as non-adherent to the treatment prescribed.<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab1">

              <Para>An initial analysis (Pearson correlation analysis) was performed to assess the relationship patterns among the different psychological processes (self-efficacy, psychological reactance, and locus of control), and the depression level (BDI), in order to identify whether there was a high covariability among them or whether they remain independents. Correlation coefficients were also obtained among those processes and the contextual variables usually associated with treatment compliance (age, educational level, treatment duration, and number of different drugs). Finally, using Morisky scale as a continuous variable, level of adherence was correlated with all of those variables.</Para>
              <Para>Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab2">2</InternalRef> shows the coefficients obtained. From a total of 21 correlation coefficients among psychological processes, only six attained statistical significance. The most prominent was the correlation between the two psychological reactance scales. There was also a considerable positive correlation between cognitive reactance and Chance subscale (locus of control). Despite these coefficients, the general pattern enables identifying the processes as relatively independent by measuring distinctive features.<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab2">

              <Para>According to the level of depression, several significant correlations were registered: negative correlations with self-efficacy and with an external locus of control (confidence in their doctors). Positive correlations were obtained for both affective and cognitive psychological reactance variables, chance external locus of control, and level of adherence. Also, a positive correlation was found between the level of depression and higher number of different drugs.</Para>
              <Para>Four statistically significant correlation coefficients with the contextual variables were found. "Number of different drugs" was negatively related to self-efficacy and positively related to psychological reactance (affective and cognitive). Self-efficacy was also positively related to educational level. The remaining coefficients did not attain statistical significance (some of them with correlations close to zero).</Para>
              <Para>Only psychological reactance subscales (affective and cognitive) attained statistical significance with level of adherence, and both in the same direction: as reactance increases there is a lower level of adherence.</Para>
              <Para>A second group of analyses was performed to determine whether the levels in those psychological processes differed between compliant and non-compliant patients (according to categoric Morisky scale classification). Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab3">3</InternalRef> summarizes the ANOVA obtained (each variable was analyzed independently), including means, standard deviations of locus of control, reactance, and self-efficacy, and a test of normal distribution. As can be observed, the external locus of control variable `Doctors' (the patients' belief of the importance of their doctors in the outcome of their depressive disorder), is not normally distributed.<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab3">

              <Para>On examination of the ANOVA results, three statistically significant differences were recorded in the cognitive factors studied; one variable was related to health locus of control and two variables refer to the psychological reactance construct. Adherent patients scored higher on the MHLC Doctors subscale, although this result must be taken with caution because of its non-normal distribution. No other health locus of control variables attained statistical significance. As for psychological reactance, both affective and cognitive subscales attained statistically significant differences between adherent and non-adherent patients: non-adherence patients scored higher for both measures, indicating more of a reactance stance when patients do not follow medical prescriptions.</Para>
              <Para>Taking into account the pattern of correlation coefficients and the differences observed in the last ANOVAs, a logistic regression analysis was performed to ascertain the relative role of these cognitive factors and health cognitions in predicting adherence to prescribed treatment. A step-by-step method was used to select only those variables that play a significant role predicting adherence. Also, to know the stability of the model, a new logistic regression was performed with a random sample (50%). Subsequently, the model obtained was tested with the rest of the sample. Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab4">4</InternalRef> summarizes the coefficients obtained.<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab4">

              <Para>According to Wald coefficients, only three variables attained statistical significance. Age was the best predictor of adherence to prescribed treatment; older patients were less likely to be adherent. The following variables in the regression analysis refer to psychological processes: a negative association with an external locus of control (there is more compliance when patients rely on their physicians), and a positive relationship with affective reactance, where more reactant patients were less compliant. Variables usually associated with adherence such as treatment complexity (number of different drugs), and treatment duration did not attain statistical significance. This general model attained statistical significance (X<Superscript>2</Superscript>(3) = 29.03; p = .000), with a 73% of patients correctly classified (cut-off point .50).</Para>
              <Para>The logistic regression with a random sample (n = 60) attained a similar pattern, with the same three variables into the equation. In this case the percentage of cases correctly classified was 71%. Finally, the projection of this model over the rest of the sample raised a 66% of cases correctly classified.</Para>
              <Para>To ascertain whether there was a specific role for type of medication, Chi-squared analyses were performed for adherence and no-adherence patients and patients who were or were not taking antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, or mood stabilizers. No statistically significant differences were obtained (antidepressants: X2[<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>] = .98; antipsychotics: X2[<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>] = 1.67; benzodiazepines: X2[<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>] = .08; mood stabilizers: X2[<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>] = .01).</Para>

              <Para>The results of this study show statistically significant associations between age, psychological reactance and doctor-attributed health locus of control and adherence to drug treatment in psychiatric outpatients with depression.</Para>
              <Para>Among the socio-demographic factors, age was the variable most consistently related to adherence; older patients were less likely to be adherent. This finding is not in line with that of some previous studies, which found a statistically significant association between older age and a lower probability of (or a longer time to) discontinuation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]. Although poor adherence to prescribed regimens could affect all age groups the prevalence of cognitive and functional impairments in elderly patients increases their risk of poor adherence in the same way as the presence of multiple co-morbidities, the polypharmacy associated and the subsequent complex medical regimens [<CitationRef CitationID="CR38">38</CitationRef>]-[<CitationRef CitationID="CR40">40</CitationRef>]. Moreover, age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic abnormalities make this population even more vulnerable to non-adherence by increasing the side effects likely to be experienced from therapy [<CitationRef CitationID="CR41">41</CitationRef>],[<CitationRef CitationID="CR42">42</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>Among the beliefs of having control over one's health, contrary to some of our hypotheses, not all variables studied influenced the health behavior of adherence since only psychological reactance led to recording a statistically significant association with self-reported adherence. As expected, there was more reactance (especially affective reactance) in less adherent patients. The hypothesis that highly psychological reactant patients would be more likely to be noncompliant than patients showing a low level of psychological reactance was confirmed by our study. Patients with low reactance generally follow instructions and advice, while people with high reactance commonly resist any guidance or assistance. People with high reactance usually have a change style focused on their own resources, personal decisions and initiatives (internal attribution of change), while people with low reactance often seek external help and support to achieve their goals (external attribution change).</Para>
              <Para>The MHLC scales results obtained appear to confirm the idea that depressive patients have appropriate beliefs concerning the management of their condition, and define themselves as informed and aware of the specific `commitment rules' related to depression and, therefore, skilled at exercising due control over it. The higher mean score recorded by depressive patients on the Doctor subscale suggests that depressive patients believe their clinicians play a crucial role in improving their state of health. As for the Other People scale, depressive patients appear to attribute major importance to `meaningful others' in the management of their illness; they believe that interpersonal relationships are fundamentally necessary to manage their condition and, in addition, they have no difficulties placing trust in others. The patients' high scores on the Internality subscale are indicative, as shown in several previous studies [<CitationRef CitationID="CR43">43</CitationRef>], that depressive patients are generally skilled at controlling their pathology and can modify their behavior patterns, in order to improve their state of health. The lower scores on the Chance scale indicate that depressive patients tend to attribute less significance to `fate and destiny' in determining the course of their illness.</Para>
              <Para>However, regarding health locus of control influence on adherence to depression treatment, although internally oriented patients' self-reported higher adherence to prescribed treatment than externally oriented patients, the differences were not statistically significant. Only the doctors' subscale was identified as a crucial determinant of adherence with prescribed treatment, with adherent patients scoring significantly higher in believing that psychiatrists were responsible for an improvement in their depression. This general absence of relationship of locus of control with adherence could be mediated by the treatment decision-making. Locus of control is a dimension related to the <Emphasis Type="Italic">causality</Emphasis> of the phenomena: perhaps if patients feel they are a significant part of the treatment outcome, locus of control dimensions would play a relevant role in adherence.</Para>
              <Para>In the case of the self-efficacy process, the absence of differences between adherent and non-adherent patients can be accounted for because it is possible this feature is more related to treatment outcome than treatment process. It is expected that if a patient trusts themself to solve their health problem, they will be more compliant with treatment. However, once again, as we argued for locus of control dimensions, this expectation could be modulated by the treatment decision-making process. Further studies need to be carried out.</Para>
              <Para>Our study has some limitations related to the methodology applied, which need to be recognized. First, although a high rate of participation was recorded in our study, our results could be affected by a selection bias, in that it could be differences in psychological features between those who agree and disagree to participate in our study. Second, our study included a convenient sample of consecutive psychiatric outpatients with depressive disorders who attend community mental health centers and this sample may not be representative of the entire population of depressive patients. Third, all questionnaires applied were self-reports, which could be related to a potential risk of misstatement or could involve response biases. Finally, another limitation of the study is the fact that only one method of estimating adherence was used. At present, several direct and indirect methods for measuring adherence are available. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, and no method is considered the gold standard. Patient questionnaires, i.e. patient self-reports, are the most useful in the clinical setting since they are simple, inexpensive and effectively measure adherence [<CitationRef CitationID="CR44">44</CitationRef>]-[<CitationRef CitationID="CR46">46</CitationRef>]. Future studies of the effect of psychological reactance and health locus of control would utilize multiple assessments of adherence (e.g. pharmacy records and self-report). As a result of the limitations reported, some caution is recommended in order to generalize our findings beyond the group studied.</Para>
              <Para>The role shown by our study for psychological reactance in adherence to prescribed treatment for depressed patients would have important implications for clinical practice. Depressed patients with high psychological reactance may perceive a large amount of clinical advice to be a threat to their freedom, and may therefore attempt to reassert this freedom through oppositional or non-compliant behavior [<CitationRef CitationID="CR47">47</CitationRef>]. If depressed, reactance prone patients perceive treatment provision to be a threat to their freedom of choice, mental health professionals should be alerted in such a way so as to avoid inducing reactance, and thus non-adherence, to prescribed treatment. Any persuasive message may arouse a motivation to reject the advocacy [<CitationRef CitationID="CR48">48</CitationRef>]. Reactant people have a tendency to act without considering potential consequences [<CitationRef CitationID="CR49">49</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>In light of the results evidenced in our study it appears important and useful that mental health professionals learn about communication techniques and counseling skills that allow them to avoid the so-called communication barriers: doctors' interventions which can cause non-adherence and hostile attitudes in the patient towards changes [<CitationRef CitationID="CR50">50</CitationRef>]. Adequate communication and partnership are not only desirable aims, but they are also possible in the mental health care of depressive patients that implements the basic rights of a group of patients who have not sufficiently benefited from consumer empowerment. Adherence to treatment will benefit from enhancing patients' view that they are responsible for their treatment decisions and when the patients' viewpoint are taken into account. Nevertheless, this paper is exploratory in nature, and should be read with caution; generalizations should be avoided in the absence of direct empirical evidence of a link between reactance and health behavior. At this time, It would be prudent to hold off making clinical recommendations or trying to generalize the findings to psychiatric patients in general.</Para>

              <Para>Psychological reactance is an important correlate of adherence to treatment in patients with depressive disorders and this needs to be considered when giving clinical advice in order to avoid inducing reactance and thus non-adherence to prescribed treatments. Mental health professionals need to learn about communication techniques and counseling skills that enable them to deal with the psychological reactance of their patients.</Para>

              <Para>Growing customer demands and more stringent regulations to reduce harmful air emissions from ships have resulted in an increased interest for the installation of shipboard abatement technologies. Specifically, the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<Subscript>x</Subscript>) was early adopted by several Swedish shipping companies. The potential NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> reduction efficiency of the SCR is well established, but the practical experiences of shipboard installations have been less documented. This paper reviews from a systems perspective the practical experiences of marine SCR installations in Swedish shipping. The aim is to identify important not only technical but also human and organizational conditions necessary for safe, efficient, and sustainable SCR operations at sea. Further, to investigate to what extent the capabilities and limitations of human operators and maintainers are taken into account in the design and installation phase of the systems. Two focus group interviews (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis> = 10) and five individual interviews were held with relevant stakeholders in the industry, following a semi-structured schedule on the themes installation, operation, maintenance, and training. The results show that deficiencies in the overall system design—with a combination of technical issues, maintenance access problems, and untrained operators with inadequate understanding of the SCR process—have led to inefficient, costly, and unsafe operations. It is concluded that installations and operations of marine SCR systems, and possibly other forthcoming abatement technologies, would benefit from the use of traditional ergonomic principles and methods. This would in turn contribute towards increased sustainability and a reduced environmental impact from shipping.</Para>

              <Para>Growing awareness of environmental implications by global shipping activities has given rise to an increased focus on strategies for safe, efficient, and sustainable sea transports (IMO <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">2011b</CitationRef>; OCIMF <CitationRef CitationID="CR42">2012</CitationRef>; INTERCARGO <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">2012</CitationRef>). Great emphasis is accorded to safety at sea, in terms of prevention of human injury or loss of life and damage to the marine environment or property (IMO <CitationRef CitationID="CR20">2002</CitationRef>), and efficiency, in balancing utilized resources (e.g. financial, time, human, or material) against accomplished goals (Stopford <CitationRef CitationID="CR51">2009</CitationRef>; Kreitner <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">2009</CitationRef>). Sustainability encompasses all this and more, requiring the reconciliation of environmental, social equity, and economic demands (WCED <CitationRef CitationID="CR52">1987</CitationRef>). Using the framework proposed in Cabezas-Basurko et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">2008</CitationRef>), sustainable sea transports can be seen as “a cost-effective commercial activity, in which the environmental load is not bigger than that which the environment can currently and in the future bear, and that the social community (directly and indirectly) in contact with it is not being negatively affected”.</Para>
              <Para>Measures to reduce the marine pollution to air include the development and implementation of various regional and supranational incentives towards the abatement of emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<Subscript>x</Subscript>). NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> is known to have an impact on the natural environment, such as eutrophication and acidification at land and sea (Pleijel <CitationRef CitationID="CR45">2009</CitationRef>), and on the public health, primarily through ground-level ozone and secondary particulate matters (HELCOM <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">2012</CitationRef>; AEA <CitationRef CitationID="CR1">2009</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para>The differentiated fairway dues in Sweden and the NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> fund in Norway are two examples of regional incentives. The environmentally differentiated fairway dues based on vessel size and emitted NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> were introduced by the Swedish Maritime Administration in 1998 (SJÖFS <CitationRef CitationID="CR49">1998</CitationRef>:13). The reduced fairway due is given upon the condition that an emission measurement report, conducted by an accredited measurement institute, is provided to the Administration every third year. The Norwegian NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> fund was set up in 2007 as a non-profit cooperative effort (NMD <CitationRef CitationID="CR40">2007</CitationRef>). The participant enterprises are exempted from the NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> tax, while instead obligated to pay a NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> fee to a fund, from which they can apply for economical support for installation and operation of NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> abatement technology (NHO <CitationRef CitationID="CR39">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para>Although not legally mandatory, these incentives have encouraged installations of NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> abatement technology on numerous merchant vessels, independent of age; primarily in the short sea shipping sector with frequent port calls in Swedish and Norwegian waters. But more stringent legislation is ahead on a supranational level that is likely to have a great impact on the global shipping community. Most notably, tier III in the revised convention of marine pollution (MARPOL) Annex VI imply an approximately 80 % reduction of NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> compared with today’s engines (IMO <CitationRef CitationID="CR21">2009</CitationRef>). On January 1, 2016, tier III enters into force in designated emission control areas (ECA) for all new buildings and vessels undergoing a major conversion. This will give rise to an increased demand on NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> abatement technology suitable for marine installations with its harsh environment and strict demands on limited space for the installation. However, in 2011 at IMO MEPC 62, it was decided to establish a correspondence group to review the status of the technological developments to implement the tier III NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions standards (IMO <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">2011a</CitationRef>). The review is to be completed not later than 2013.</Para>
              <Para>There are several different NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> abatement technologies available on the market, including internal engine modifications, exhaust gas recirculation, direct water injection, humid air motor, and selective catalytic reduction (Entec <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2005</CitationRef>). However, not all technologies are able to reach tier III by themselves; some must be used in combination with other technologies. Currently, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is considered one of the most effective technologies on the market that single-handedly can meet tier III (Entec <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2005</CitationRef>; Lövblad and Fridell <CitationRef CitationID="CR36">2006</CitationRef>; IMO <CitationRef CitationID="CR24">2012</CitationRef>). During the last 15–20 years, SCR has been extensively investigated for reduction of NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> from land-based heavy-duty vehicles (see, for instance, Heck and Farrauto <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">1995</CitationRef>; Pârvulescu et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR44">1998</CitationRef>; Koebel et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR29">2000</CitationRef>; Gabrielsson <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">2004</CitationRef>). Research and application of marine SCR installations have, however, remained sparse throughout the years, possibly due to the lack of legal requirements or other incentives. Further, preceding research and development activities have primarily focused on technical aspects and engineering principles. The human and organizational elements within the system have largely been disregarded.</Para>
              <Para>The advent of mechanization, automation, and communication technology made many manual tasks redundant, turning the human operator into a supervisor, rather than a controller of technical systems. Thus, the operators have moved “out of the loop”, intervening within the control loop primarily for abnormal situations (Sheridan <CitationRef CitationID="CR48">2006</CitationRef>; Norman <CitationRef CitationID="CR41">1990</CitationRef>). Out-of-the-loop performance problems are related to the loss of manual skills and an impaired awareness of the systems’ state and processes (Endsley and Kiris <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">1995</CitationRef>). As technical systems increase in complexity, the gap between the human operator and the machine tends to increase as well. It is difficult for the operators to understand what the technical systems actually do and how to correctly detect and assess problems. This gap between human and machine has caused errors, incidents, and accidents affecting safety and efficiency of operations in several domains, including the maritime (Lee <CitationRef CitationID="CR35">2006</CitationRef>; Reason <CitationRef CitationID="CR46">1990</CitationRef>).</Para>
              <Para>Contemporary SCR units are highly automated, but in order to ensure effective catalytic NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> reduction, there are still several important technical parameters to monitor and control during operation, such as exhaust gas temperature and flow, urea injection and back pressure. Certainly, safe and efficient operation and maintenance pose demands on the level of knowledge, skills and competence of the crew as operators and supervisors of the SCR. But, responsibilities can also be found on management level. In the installation phase, when ordering and designing an SCR unit, the management is responsible for ensuring that relevant operational requirements are identified and met. During operations and maintenance, the allocation of adequate resources such as personnel, time, and materials may be considered.</Para>

                <Para>The present paper draws from the practical experiences of the pioneering SCR installations in Swedish short sea shipping. The purpose is to explore the human–machine aspects of SCR installations from a systems perspective.

              <Heading>Research design</Heading>
              <Para>Due to the scarcity of previous research in the problem domain, an explorative, qualitative research design was adopted. For the purpose of data completeness and, to a lesser extent, confirmation of data, a combination of focus group interviews and individual interviews was used (Lambert and Loiselle <CitationRef CitationID="CR33">2008</CitationRef>). This combination of data collection methods allowed us to elicit rich, detailed information on practical experiences of marine SCR installations. In order to enable as broad an understanding of the topic as possible, data collection was made from a range of stakeholder participants representing different interests and views. All interviews were held in Swedish and the translation of quotes in this paper is made by the authors.</Para>

                <Heading>Focus group interviews</Heading>
                <Para>Focus group interviews are usually characterized by five elements: they involve (1) a group of people, composed of (2) participants with certain features important to the researcher, that (3) solicits qualitative data in a (4) carefully planned focused discussion, in order to (5) gain understanding of the chosen topic through the eyes of the target audience (Krueger and Casey <CitationRef CitationID="CR31">2009</CitationRef>). The group dynamics and interaction that occur in focus group interviews are a vital part of the method, using the communication between research participants to generate data. Instead of a researcher asking individuals to respond to a series of questions in turn, the participants are encouraged to, in their own vocabulary, ask each other questions, narrate anecdotes, and comment on each other’s experiences and points of view (Krueger and Casey <CitationRef CitationID="CR31">2009</CitationRef>). Focus group interviews are particularly useful for exploring participants’ knowledge and experiences, probing not only <Emphasis Type="Italic">what</Emphasis> people think but <Emphasis Type="Italic">how</Emphasis> they think and <Emphasis Type="Italic">why</Emphasis> they think that way (Kitzinger <CitationRef CitationID="CR28">1995</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para>Two focus group interviews were held (<Emphasis Type="Italic">n</Emphasis> = 10) with top or middle managers recruited on the basis of their anticipated first-hand knowledge and experiences of SCR catalysts. The participants represented two different SCR manufacturers, one in each focus group, and six Swedish shipping companies that have installed SCR catalysts during the past 15 years, holding a valid NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> certificate issued by the Swedish Maritime Administration (SJÖFS <CitationRef CitationID="CR49">1998</CitationRef>:13). Together, the shipping companies represented the segments of liquid bulk, roll on/roll off, passenger, and offshore supply vessels.</Para>
                <Para>The two focus groups were moderated by the same, professional moderator with extensive knowledge on the features and routines of the shipping industry, but purposely less versed in the technical details surrounding SCR units. Thus, the moderator had the advantage of being able to instill a sense of mutual respect within the groups and communicate in a shared vocabulary but still be emotionally detached from the topic of the study (Krueger and Casey <CitationRef CitationID="CR31">2009</CitationRef>). The authors of this paper acted as listeners, observers, and analysts.</Para>
                <Para>Both focus groups followed the same semi-structured interview guide with predominantly open-ended questions about SCR installations on the three themes of the following:

                <Para>The guide was developed through considerable reflection by the researchers, in collaboration with the moderator. Each focus group interview lasted for approximately 90 min and were video- and audio-recorded for transcript and analysis. The focus groups concluded with the participants anonymously answering a structured questionnaire to assess if the group discussions had succeeded in capturing the most important practical experiences on the three themes, respectively, whether the participants felt that they had the opportunity to express their opinion, and the potential usefulness of the discussions to the participants.</Para>

                <Heading>Semi-structured qualitative interviews</Heading>
                <Para>Individual interview is a frequently used data collection method in qualitative research and is typically chosen to gather comprehensive accounts of attitudes, views, and knowledge regarding a given topic. Kvale (<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">1997</CitationRef>) describes the qualitative research interview as a conversation with a structure and a purpose, aiming for insights and new understandings. The knowledge process in an interview is an interactive process between interviewer and interviewee. Hence, it is important to check continuously that the interpretation of the said is accepted by the informant. By using semi-structured interviews, it is feasible to compare the answers from several interviews and, to some extent, make some generalizations.</Para>
                <Para>Five individual, semi-structured interviews were held, using the same thematic interview guide as the focus group interviews, but allowing for flexibility to probe for details or further discuss issues. Additional questions were asked and answers probed on an individual basis during the interviews. The informants were not randomly selected, but chosen among specific stakeholders with experiences considered relevant by the researchers. The informants were recruited from the Environment and Sustainability unit at the Swedish Shipowners’ Association; the Transport Policy and International Cooperation unit at the Swedish Maritime Administration; a senior technical manager at a leading marine mutual insurer; an expert consultant with a large buyer of dry cargo transport; and a vetting coordinator at an oil company. The interviews lasted for approximately 1 h and were audio-recorded for transcript and analysis.</Para>

                <Para>In qualitative research, the dividing line between data collection and data analysis can be vague, and there are few well-established and generally accepted rules for analysis (Bryman and Bell <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2007</CitationRef>). Rather than being a distinct activity following the data collection, qualitative data analysis occur continuously in a dynamic interplay, shaping the next phase of data collection by developing new routes of inquiry and refining questions (Krueger and Casey <CitationRef CitationID="CR31">2009</CitationRef>). The analyzing and interpreting of data can be described as a process to bring structure, order, and meaning to the data, in short—making sense of the data. The central elements of analysis in this work is guided by the strategies described by Mays and Pope (<CitationRef CitationID="CR38">1995</CitationRef>) and include transcription of audio and video recordings and an iterative systematization, categorization, and recombining of data to look for meanings and causes.</Para>

                  </BlockQuote>
                </Para>
                <Para>Churchman claimed that, rather than knowing all there is to know about a studied system, it is important to understand the possible implications of our lack of comprehensive knowledge. It is because we never know enough that understanding and critical judgment become essential, from an intellectual as well as a moral point of view.</Para>
                <Para>Apart from the technical artifacts, human actors and the social infrastructure are essential for the functionality of the system as a whole, aptly described in the concept of sociotechnical systems (Emery and Trist <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">1960</CitationRef>). Humans are present in all work systems, as inventors, designers, users, operators, maintainers, and so forth. Even a highly automated system requires people—if there is nothing else to start, stop, and monitor the system. Often, users and operators also perform service and maintenance on machinery and equipment in the system. Unlike the other components in the system, the human actors are free to act and often complete the feedback loop between system performance and system goal; they correct system failures (Hughes <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">1987</CitationRef>). A sociotechnical system refers to the interdependency of social and technical aspects in a system. The starting point is a perceived lack of mutual understanding of the technical society in which engineers allegedly ignore the social concerns of their work, and social scientists ignore technology. In this respect, a systems model can be a tool to bring both sides together and portray both social and technical phenomena; the “technization” of society and the socialization of technology (Ropohl <CitationRef CitationID="CR47">1999</CitationRef>). The benefits of a sociotechnical system that is designed to take the operators abilities and limitations into account include reduced learning time for new equipment, fewer incidents, and accidents related to misuse or misunderstandings, and reduced risk for musculoskeletal disorders among users.</Para>

                <Para>However, under normal pressure and temperatures, ammonia is a highly volatile gas; hence, the use of urea, as a reducing agent, is favored. When heated, urea decomposes into ammonia and isocyanic acid where the acid in the presence of water is further decomposed over the catalyst into ammonia and carbon dioxide (Lundström <CitationRef CitationID="CR37">2010</CitationRef>). The ideal thermal decomposition process of 1 mol of urea gives 2 mol of ammonia and 1 mol of carbon dioxide (Koebel et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR29">2000</CitationRef>):

                <Para>Further, the choice of base metal in the catalyst is dependent on the operating temperature, where a vanadium-based catalyst works well in the temperature range of 260–450 °C (Heck and Farrauto <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">1995</CitationRef>). It is therefore commonly used in catalysts for automotive diesel engines (Koebel et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR29">2000</CitationRef>) but also for marine applications (Lövblad and Fridell <CitationRef CitationID="CR36">2006</CitationRef>) with a reported catalytic NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> reduction efficiency of 90 % (Entec <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">2005</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para>However, almost all catalytic materials decay in activity with time where three major factors are sintering (loss of surface area), attrition (powdering of catalyst, blocking reactor, reducing gas flow), and poisoning (loss of catalytic activity per unit area), respectively (Bowker <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">1998</CitationRef>). An important deactivation mechanism for an SCR catalyst operating downstream a diesel engine, in the presence of ammonium, sulfur, and water, is the formation of ammonium sulfates which may result in pore blocking and related catalytic deactivation (Huang et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2002</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">2003</CitationRef>; Zhu et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR53">2001</CitationRef>; Kijlstra et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">1996</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para>Furthermore, the catalytic NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> reduction efficiency is also dependent upon the space velocity, which is calculated by dividing the exhaust gas flow (in cubic meters per hour) with the catalyst volume (in cubic meters) (Heck and Farrauto <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">1995</CitationRef>). It has been showed that an increased space velocity over a vanadium-based catalyst may lead to increased deactivation, and Huang et al. (<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">2002</CitationRef>) suggest that the deactivation could be reduced by a decreased space velocity.</Para>
                <Para>Evidently, the SCR installation includes several technical components which have to be carefully designed in order to work as a well-integrated NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> reducing system.

                <Heading>Installation of marine SCR catalysts</Heading>
                <Para>On the theme of installation of SCR catalysts, the data were sub-divided in the segments of motives for installation, choosing a supplier, and decision-making structures.</Para>

                  <Heading>Motives for installation</Heading>
                  <Para>Two clear motives for an SCR installation, either a retrofit on an existing vessel or a newbuilding, emerge: corporate environmental image and commercial benefits. A main driving force has been meeting customer or cargo owner’s demands for NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> abatement technology. In some cases, the cargo owner has even funded the initial SCR installation, while others, depending on charterparty, compensate for the urea.</Para>
                  <Para>In an individual interview, a representative for an oil company believes that the cargo owners are a significant driving force:<BlockQuote>
                      <Para>Frankly, I do not think any of the shipowners [that they have contracted] would have installed any kind of exhaust gas cleaning unless we had put it forward as a direct demand.</Para>
                    </BlockQuote>
                  </Para>
                  <Para>The commercial benefits such as environmentally differentiated fairway dues and port fees have been effective principally within the RoPax sector (vessels built for both wheeled cargo and passenger transport), with multiple port calls every day and vessels that spend a lot of time in the fairway. According to a project manager on a RoPax company, the investment in SCR catalysts on two RoPax vessels had a pay-back time in just over 2 years. In one focus group, the informants representing two different tanker companies, however, claimed that the differentiated fairway dues made little or no difference for them:<BlockQuote>
                      <Para>Well, you can never get the money back [for the installation]. It is only a cost. Yes, I agree. Unless you get paid on TC [time charter] or traffic, for example, the Norwegian coast all the time, there are no incentives what so ever to install this type of equipment if you do not have a company policy for the environment and are ready to take this cost, because you will never get the investment cost back during the prevailing market, as it is now.</Para>
                    </BlockQuote>
                  </Para>
                  <Para>The tanker owners both continue to describe how they try to market the added value to brokers and oil companies, but although there is a candid interest in environment issues, it is difficult to get the customers to, in fact, pay extra for the NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> abatement. Conversely, in the individual interview the oil company representative states that they require all ships on time charter for them to be equipped with NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> abatement technology. They as charterers pay for the urea consumption and the costs for installation of SCR are supposedly compensated for in the contract. Likewise, an informant with offshore supply vessels in their fleet added that having SCR on board had been crucial when receiving a contract for work in Alaska.</Para>
                  <Para>This limited interest in differentiated fairway dues has also been noted by the Swedish Maritime Administration that recently has seen a declining number of applications for renewing NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> certificates.</Para>

                  <Heading>Choosing an SCR supplier</Heading>
                  <Para>Generally, for both a retrofit and newbuilding installation, the price is the prime consideration and the second is how flexible and adaptable the system is to the vessel.</Para>
                  <Para>For a retrofit installation on an existing vessel, the informants have mainly used references from other shipping companies on which SCR supplier to choose, sometimes also in communication with the engine maker. Though, limited space is always an issue, and the installation can be even further complicated if the vessel was not built prepared for SCR at an initial design phase.</Para>
                  <Para>Conversely, a newbuilding installation is considered to be rather easy and the SCR supplier is generally chosen from the “makers list” presented by the shipyard, as of other equipment and machinery. This was especially the view of the two participating SCR suppliers, who said that they mostly engage with the shipyards as customers rather than the shipowners directly as is the case for a retrofit. But, several informants argued that quality and functionality of the installation depends on the shipyard and the relation between the yard and the shipowner. One informant described a case where they as shipowners had a longstanding relationship with a yard they considered to have good technical competence:<BlockQuote>
                      <Para>… basically, we just told them [the yard] which SCR we wanted and then we did not have anything to do with it until we started it up to check that it worked. […] If we had made this installation somewhere else we would have done it in cooperation with the maker in an entirely different way, but here there was no reason. They took care of it brilliantly.</Para>
                    </BlockQuote>
                  </Para>
                  <Para>Another informant described a similar scenario:<BlockQuote>
                      <Para>… the problem is, I mean, you have your makers list, but if you do not go down and specify what you want, it is a bit of a lottery. The primary is not that the system works, but … as long as the pieces are there, some yards reckon you will just slide out of the claims period and then the owner has to take the costs to make the systems actually work.</Para>

                  <Heading>Decision making</Heading>
                  <Para>The decision making regarding SCR installations is predominantly made on top management level in the shore organization. As described earlier, the decision can be more or less prompted by the customer or cargo owner who, in some cases. also has been deeply involved in the process, both financially and technically. The end-users—the crew on board—are however rarely involved.<BlockQuote>
                      <Para>…the crew have not worked with catalysts before at all, they have no knowledge of it, so we at the office take care of the tenders… in the end we hand over the papers to the purchasing manager to negotiate the last per cent.</Para>
                    </BlockQuote>
                  </Para>
                  <Para>In one case, however, the crew have played a significant part in the process. On a vessel with one of the first marine SCR installations in Sweden, done in the mid-1990s, the recent process for replacing the old SCR with a new system was managed largely by the crew. One of the focus groups had participants from both supplier and company, one of them working as chief engineer on the vessel. Here, years of trouble-shooting and efforts to operate the old, regularly malfunctioning SCR system had led to a somewhat personal relationship between the supplier and crew.</Para>

                <Heading>Operation, service, and maintenance </Heading>
                <Para>On the theme of operation, service, and maintenance of SCR catalysts, the data were sub-divided in the segments of urea supply and quality (an area evidently of great interest for most informants), technical design issues, operation and operational disturbances, and service and maintenance.</Para>
                <Section3 ID="Sec16">
                  <Heading>Urea supply and quality</Heading>
                  <Para>The supply and quality of urea prompted many discussions in both focus groups, and the subject was also given ample attention in the individual interviews. Good urea quality was considered essential for a well-functioning SCR system, generally, the more expensive, the better the quality. The informants with RoPax vessels operating in the Baltic Sea reported no problems with either quality or supply, probably due to the nature of the traffic enabling them to have standing orders of urea and keep own depots.</Para>
                  <Para>But, informants with vessels with other port calls and vessels trading on the spot market reported numerous problems with both supply and quality, especially in ports outside northern Europe. Since urea deliveries commonly are made by truck from Sweden, the order must be placed in time. For vessels on the spot market this can turn into a proper logistics challenge with orders being placed based on an educated guess, trucks having to be rerouted to other ports, or canceled. Moreover, this has also led to a discussion on how these transports affect the environment and if, in the end, it can be justified from a life-cycle perspective. One informant said that under circumstances such as these, they opt not to operate the SCR.</Para>
                  <Para>On several occasions, vessels have received urea that was believed to be destined for agricultural use, resulting in severe operation disturbances. In an individual interview, an expert consultant with a dry cargo owner describes how they have encountered numerous problems due to poor urea quality. In one example, the vessel was in service for only 60 h before the catalytic blocks were completely clogged and had to be renewed.</Para>

                  <Heading>Technical design issues</Heading>
                  <Para>In any marine SCR installation, the space requirements are kept to an absolute minimum to ensure maximum cargo carrying capacity. As noted earlier, the restricted space is especially apparent in retrofitting, and several cases of conscious sub-optimizations of the SCR installation were described. For example, an insufficient exhaust pipe diameter, causing high gas velocities, in connection to an insufficient distance between the urea injectors and the catalyst, would not allow for a homogeneous mixture of urea and exhaust gas, hence resulting in a reduced overall SCR efficiency and the accompanied difficulties to achieve the NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emission targets. In another installation, it was perceived that the supplier had positioned the urea injector rather haphazardly without giving much thought to the above.<BlockQuote>
                      <Para>We have seen that it is important where you put the catalyst. It can cause problem with the exhaust gas temperature, among other things, with too big a distance between. It amounts to pretty large costs when you have installed the system if you then have to rebuild it again and then the economists start talking—should we really go with this, is it worth it?</Para>
                    </BlockQuote>
                  </Para>
                  <Para>The operational temperature of the SCR is not reached as quickly as the exhaust gas temperature. Especially for ships passing through areas with speed limititions, such as the archipelago, it may take a long time to reach the working temperature adequate for NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> reduction. Furthermore, the low engine load may lead to accumulation of soot and particles from the exhaust gas on the catalytic blocks, which then become deactivated. In cases like these, pre-warming of the SCR is necessary, but that in turn leads to increased emissions of carbon dioxide.</Para>
                  <Para>Early SCR systems were claimed to be poorly adapted to the harsh marine environment, considering vibrations and exhaust gas composition and soot due to the type of fuel and lubrication oil commonly used. An example of which were the early onboard NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> measurement devices:<BlockQuote>
                      <Para>These NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> analysers, they are also something taken from ashore. Having such a system up in the funnel with hoses and filters and air… it is far from optimum.</Para>

                  </Para>
                  <Para>More recent SCR installations are however perceived as being better adapted in that respect. In one case, it is described how the installation of SCR systems on main and auxiliary engines even contributed to lower noise levels, a circumstance appreciated by both engine crew and the ports.</Para>

                  <Heading>Operation and operational disturbances</Heading>
                  <Para>It was noted during the focus groups and individual interviews that many informants initially said to have no problems with the SCR and that it supposedly is a very easy system to operate.<BlockQuote>
                      <Para>It works very well, in principle you push a button and then you don’t do anything but fill urea.</Para>

                  </Para>
                  <Para>However, as time passed during the discussions and interviews, plenty of complications began to surface with technical components such as urea injectors, air blowers, and urea dosing. Yet, the same informant was still very satisfied with the operation, revealing tremendous patience:<BlockQuote>
                      <Para>… it has been 2.5 years now and it has worked without, well I believe this injector nozzle fell off and broke once and then nothing worked, and some air blowing jets have broken, but those are small things. The functionality has been, I mean it runs 100 per cent, except when it shuts down by itself.</Para>
                    </BlockQuote>
                  </Para>
                  <Para>Further, it became clear that the chemical process of the SCR is not well known. Several of the informants gave evidence to the complexity of the SCR system, picking up the term “hocus-pocus” from an earlier similar statement from another informant in the same focus group:<BlockQuote>
                      <Para>… as long as it works, there are no questions asked, but when you are in deep water—asking what is happening, why is it not working? I have experienced from both supplier and from our own crew and technical management ashore that it is a bit of ‘hocus-pocus’, one is guessing, are not really sure—should we test another type of stones [the metal catalysts]?, and so on. In principle, the definitive answer does not exist.</Para>

                  <Para>The functionality of the SCR is verified officially through the mandatory NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> certification measurement every third year (SJÖFS <CitationRef CitationID="CR49">1998</CitationRef>:13) for those vessels that have been granted reduced fairway dues. Some shipping companies have opted to measure more often while others have no extra monitoring in between these measurements, thus having no control of the functionality of the SCR and the related NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> reduction over the intermediate time period of 3 years. On the whole, the measurement of NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> and ammonium slip was regarded as costly and cumbersome, especially concerning the time it takes to get the results. As much as 3–4 weeks have been known to lapse between measurement and report, and if the result is not good, the measurement has to be redone.</Para>

                  <Heading>Service and maintenance</Heading>
                  <Para>The lack of space for the installation obviously affects accessibility for maintenance and service tasks. The system includes a number of parts that need to be changed and filters to be cleaned regularly, and this was not always well accommodated for in the design and installation phase. When the catalyst stones need to be changed, this is done by opening special hatches. Several layers of cassettes of old stones weighing 25–30 kg are removed and new ones put in place, sometimes through a barely 50-cm-wide opening. This hazardous task involves heavy lifting, turning of the body with a heavy load, and the assuming of awkward body postures with apparent risk for acute and/or long-term musculoskeletal disorders. Two of the informants had experienced occupational health and safety incidents during maintenance work. In one case, four people were hospitalized due to respiratory problems after changing contaminated stones without protective equipment. In the other incident, a large steel plate came loose inside the SCR and nearly hit a welder, missing his head by a few centimeters.</Para>
                  <Para>Service instructions and intervals are recorded in typical service manuals. These are, however, not always written in such a clear and precise manner as the crew would have wanted. While, on the other hand, the suppliers argue that the manuals are indeed written for readers assumed to have a certain pre-understanding of technical and electrical matters. On a RoPax ferry, the crew arranged for the service manual to be updated after 2 years of operation since they thought the instructions were “poorly described”.</Para>
                  <Para>Although the interviews contained a number of stories ranging from minor operational failures to severe breakdowns, none of the informants had ever made a claim to the insurance company. Nor had the informant working as senior manager at a marine insurer heard of any such claims. The reasons for this can be found in the large deductible (ranging from US$ 75,000 to 200,000) and the need for the incident leading up to the potential claim to be a sudden and unexpected event. Hitherto, all costs associated with these failures and breakdowns, primarily for equipment and working hours, have therefore been carried by the owner, sometimes together with a cargo owner. The extra costs for overuse of urea due to mismanagement and/or poor tuning of the SCR are carried by the owner or cargo owner depending on charterparty.</Para>
                  <Para>Examples were also given on long delivery times for spare parts. In one extreme case, the SCR was inoperable for 9 months, while the vessel had to wait for delivery of new stones.</Para>

                <Heading>Knowledge and training</Heading>
                <Para>Just as the operational problems developed from none to several during the interviews, a similar pattern was noted regarding the need for knowledge and training. Initially, it was unanimously stated that the SCR is not a system that requires any extra training or knowledge. A vessel contains hundreds of systems with the SCR being just one of them, and the crew is expected to be able to operate the SCR on the basis of their previous engineering experiences. In addition, since the SCR is not a safety critical system it is not prioritized for special training.<BlockQuote>
                    <Para>… the vessel moves just as well from A to B without it. So, I believe it takes some sort of interest and engagement from the people on board, like the chief engineer; otherwise it is easier to shut it down, then you don’t even have small problem. It is not like a main engine. A malfunctioning main engine—that is a huge problem you have to solve. If the SCR is not working, well it is just as well.</Para>
                  </BlockQuote>
                </Para>
                <Para>Further, since a shipping company has at least two, sometimes three, persons employed for each position on board, it is regarded too costly to educate every operator, including costs such as salary and subsistence allowance. After the initial installation, the supplier usually instructs the operators that are on board at the time. The crew are therefore supposed to educate and transfer the knowledge to each other.</Para>
                <Para>Nevertheless, during the interviews, a number of examples on arrangements of extra training were reported. One company had even engaged a researcher specializing in combustion technology to give lectures to all engine officers on board:<BlockQuote>
                    <Para>… we had all engine officers on board there, to give them an understanding for what happens. No one can explain the catalytic process, it is just there, we have to accept that, but what happens when you inject urea and what it takes to make it work and all that, temperatures and such. That, I think is well appreciated. Then perhaps you get another understanding for how the process works. […] One needs to have an understanding of what you are doing, because this is nothing you study at the merchant marine academy.</Para>
                  </BlockQuote>
                </Para>
                <Para>The same informant continued to describe how they afterwards “kicked out” the SCR supplier since they now felt that they had more knowledge than the supplier who could not contribute to the solution of the operational disturbances they experienced.</Para>
                <Para>Both suppliers, on the other hand, expressed a clear interest in operator training. It was stated by one of the suppliers that they do not consider the SCR installation to be a complete delivery until they have ensured that a knowledge structure among the crew is in place. At least one person on board should have specific knowledge on how to operate the SCR.<BlockQuote>
                    <Para>I know that I can avoid a dreadful amount of telephone calls to me as supplier if I know that at least one person knows enough.</Para>

                </Para>
                <Para>Among the cargo owners, there was no distinct request for training; rather, it was taken for granted that the crew had adequate knowledge and training to ensure safe operation of all systems on board, including the SCR. The external expert with the dry cargo owner had once, however, participated in a project with a shipowner in creating generic guidelines for SCR operation that had been communicated to various stakeholders, among others the Swedish Maritime Administration.</Para>

                <Para>Overall, the participants in both focus group interviews considered it rewarding to participate (Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>). Individual statements indicate the significance of having these meetings physically, face-to-face. One participant wanted more time for discussion, another more stakeholders, and a third wanted to exclude the SCR suppliers, thus potentially opening up the discussions further.

                <Heading>Methodological considerations</Heading>
                <Para>The purpose of this paper was to explore the human–machine aspects of SCR installations from a systems perspective. In order to obtain a comprehensive understanding, the research design included triangulation of methods (Bryman and Bell <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2007</CitationRef>) by combining focus groups and semi-structured individual interviews. Since the data collection is based on a limited number of group and individual interviews, the informant participation is important in that the informants are honest, consistent, they keep to the subject, and give comprehensive answers (Kvale <CitationRef CitationID="CR32">1997</CitationRef>). There is a possibility during interviews that the informants might offer answers and reflections that put themselves and/or the companies they represent in a good light. This possibility has been considered, and the study has strived for a critical approach in the analysis of the empirical data. The selection of informants was purposeful rather than random, and the fact that the authors during the project were approached by people who volunteered to participate in the focus groups indicates an interest in the study. Far from all possible stakeholders were included in the study. There were, for example, no respondents representing classification societies or the inspectorate at the maritime division of the Transport Agency.</Para>
                <Para>The study is limited by its clear Scandinavian focus with the boundaries set by prevailing national and regional regulations and conditions. But with the onset of the Revised MARPOL tier III, the results of this study will be relevant also outside Scandinavia and underlines the need of considering not only the strict technical aspects of SCR but also the human-oriented aspects when evaluating the overall efficiency of SCR.</Para>
                <Para>The results of the two focus group evaluations indicate that the study succeeded in capturing what was set out to capture; thus, the authors believe the internal validity (Bryman and Bell <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">2007</CitationRef>) to be good. The results also show that, to a large extent, the informants felt that they could speak their mind and that they learnt from the experience pointing towards the usefulness of face-to-face group meetings for creating common awareness and knowledge transfer.</Para>
              </Section2>
              <Section2 ID="Sec24">
                <Heading>Stakeholder relations</Heading>
                <Para>One of the most prominent findings to emerge was the importance of rapport (mutual understanding or trust) between the different actors in the system—supplier, shipyard, shipowner, cargo owner/customer, and operator. When the dialog is working, it seems, so is the SCR. This is consistent with, for example, Guinan (<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">1986</CitationRef>) who proposes that communication between designers and users is positively related to the outcome of the design. In the context of this study, however, it seems that also the relationship between shipyard and shipowner is of great importance for the outcome. The informants who have built their ships at yards with which they have long-term relations have expressed confidence and trust in the yard’s technical competence. These informants trust the yard to have an honest ambition of making the SCR system work and not only put the pieces together. But, the mutual trust must work both ways. In one example, the yard was said to have stated early on that it was not possible to build according to specifications. The owner, however, insisted, a number of operational problems followed, and ultimately, at great expense, a major alteration was needed.</Para>
                <Para>During the design and installation phase, the knowledge resources of the crew are not utilized since the crew often lacks previous experience on operating an SCR. This line of thought, however, does not acknowledge the knowledge on the context in which the system is about to operate in. A previous research shows several benefits of involving operators in workplace design. Some benefits are related to the results of the design, others to the expected gains in the operators’ qualification and motivation, and some with the functionality of the entire work organization (Launis <CitationRef CitationID="CR34">2001</CitationRef>). In complex work processes, it is ever more likely that the operator can contribute on the topic of task execution, work activities, and work environment during normal and abnormal operations. In addition, the participative design process implies an expansive learning of all stakeholders involved; the operators convey experience and feedback regarding usage to the designers, and the designers provide understanding of the system’s function and operation. The mutual understanding supports the designer in designing more operable systems and the operators to operate them more efficiently and reliably (Launis <CitationRef CitationID="CR34">2001</CitationRef>). It is therefore suggested that a collaborative installation process involving both operators on board and technical management in the shore organization would contribute towards a deeper understanding of how the SCR works, thus enabling a more efficient NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> reduction. It is believed that this would be possible for both installations on new buildings and for retrofit installations. For a newbuilding where the crew have yet to be appointed, it is possible to instead utilize the knowledge and experiences of other engine officers or cadets that can represent the “typical users”, as described, for example, in a study involving nautical cadets in a bridge design process (Österman et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR43">2011</CitationRef>).</Para>

                <Heading>Maturity of infrastructure and technology</Heading>
                <Para>The distribution and quality of urea prompted many discussions during both focus groups and individual interviews. Informants operating vessels with various port calls as opposed to a regular schedule had experienced difficulties in ordering and receiving urea, especially when being rerouted to another port with short notice. Concerns were also expressed among the informants regarding the net environmental load of using urea that has been transported by lorry from Sweden to continental Europe. However, a previous research on environmental trade-offs in NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> removal from ships suggests that a marine SCR installation gives a considerable decrease in environmental impact including the transport of urea (Andersson and Winnes <CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2011</CitationRef>). On the topic of urea quality, a quality standard similar to the standard for land-based applications is supposedly under way also for marine use and would likely be beneficial for the quality of SCR operations.</Para>
                <Para>During the focus groups and individual interviews, the success stories were far outnumbered by the stories of things falling apart, clogged stones, and ineffective NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> reduction. Even the cases where the SCR reportedly ran without problem turned out to have room for improvements, suggesting a high threshold for problems among the informants. One is so used to face technical complications that it takes a lot to acknowledge that there is a problem. This phenomenon, a normalization of the conditions can have social or psychological reasons. One form of normalization is the so called system evolution (Backström <CitationRef CitationID="CR3">1996</CitationRef>) where the human continuously adapts to small, solitary changes in a system that slowly becomes more and more unstable without anyone really noticing. When an accident or breakdown suddenly occurs, it is often described as a bolt out of the blue.</Para>
                <Para>The findings suggest that many of the difficulties of operating SCR systems can be found in the design and installation phase. The SCR is seemingly viewed more or less as a “black box”, with no one to tell what actually happens inside. The system builders appear to lack sufficient knowledge on the importance of the urea injection design and exhaust gas velocity over the catalysts for a well-functioning SCR; this can, in turn, lead to costly, sub-optimized installations with poor NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> reduction. Drawing from the interview results, it seems that this built-in sub-optimization occasionally may have been conscious.</Para>
                <Para>The restricted space on board not only affects the technical functionality, in terms of correct exhaust gas velocity and placing of urea injectors for an efficient thermal decomposition and subsequent catalytic reduction, but it was also found to affect the accessibility for routine and repair work increasing the risk for human errors and occupational accidents. To accommodate for the limited space, it is therefore suggested that traditional human factors engineering tools, such as methods for analyses of tasks, functions, and interfaces analyses (Stanton et al. <CitationRef CitationID="CR50">2005</CitationRef>), are used routinely.</Para>

                <Heading>Knowledge and training</Heading>
                <Para>On the theme of knowledge and training, a lack of structure for knowledge transfer was identified. Since the SCR is regarded neither as safety critical nor as a particularly complex system—despite the several expressions of how incomprehensible the catalytic process is—no special training is required, and no special training courses are offered by the SCR suppliers beyond the introduction at the initial start-up. This requires that for good functionality and efficiency, the SCR installation, in general, and its user interfaces, in particular, must be designed for good guessability (it is easy to correctly guess how something works and what happens is, for example, a certain button is pushed) and learnability (it is easy for the operator to learn how it works and remember correct actions) (Jordan <CitationRef CitationID="CR26">1998</CitationRef>).</Para>
                <Para>Moreover, it was found that the crew was expected to transfer the knowledge to colleagues and successors, something that demands that the instructor possess pedagogical as well as technical skills. To adequately transfer knowledge, one must have a thorough understanding of how the SCR works, and also dedicated time, since the SCR is but one of many systems to master for an engine officer.</Para>
                <Para>It is further believed that more knowledge is needed on a number of technical aspects that appear to affect the functionality of the SCR. Future experiments are needed to assess the impact of various types of urea qualities and also the effect on exhaust gas composition of different types of marine fuel and lubrication oils commonly used. Today, the vessels take active part in the development of SCR systems for marine applications, both technically and economically. The costs for malfunctioning SCR installations are carried chiefly by the shipping company, sometimes in collaboration with the cargo owner. The costs are primarily associated with necessary re-designs, material, working hours, energy, and waste, such as overuse of urea or catalyst stones not operating its full estimated service life. For inefficient or non-existent NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> reduction, when the problems have escalated to a decision to simply shut the SCR off, the costs can also be measured on a societal level in terms of unhealthy emissions to air and increased eutrophication and acidification at land and sea.</Para>
                <Para>It is fair to believe that many human, technical, and organizational aspects identified in this study can be transferred to other existing and forthcoming marine systems on board. On the topic of environmental technology, the near future sees a number of pending installations such as marine scrubber systems to remove sulfur dioxide from exhaust gas and water treatment systems to remove organisms from ballast tanks.</Para>

              <Heading>Conclusions</Heading>
              <Para>The present study contributes to the body of knowledge on marine SCR installations by adding a systems perspective of the installation, comprising technical, human, and organizational conditions for safe, efficient, and sustainable operations of SCR catalysts on ships.</Para>
              <Para>Although the actual NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> reduction with marine SCR catalysts is high in successful installations, there are still technical and operational issues that need to be resolved for forthcoming SCR installations. Principally regarding the supply and quality of urea, the design, and placing of urea injection, and exhaust gas composition due to various marine fuels and lubrication oils.</Para>
              <Para>The results indicate that there are currently no structures or procedures in place to ensure that physical and cognitive capabilities and limitations of the human operators and maintainers are taken into account in the design process. Also lacking is a structure for training and the development and transfer of knowledge on how the SCR works and how to properly operate and maintain the SCR. This absence of structures and procedures are a contributing source to the common operational disturbances with an increased risk for occupational accidents and unnecessary harmful air emissions to the environment. The costs for this are carried by shipowners, cargo owners, and the society.</Para>
              <Para>In conclusion, using traditional ergonomic principles and methods in the design and installation process of marine SCR systems, and possibly other forthcoming abatement technologies, would contribute towards an improved overall system performance. It would also contribute towards reaching future environmental targets regarding NO<Subscript>x</Subscript> emissions from short sea shipping.</Para>
              <Para>In general, it seems that clear and concise incentives are needed for installation and operation of marine SCR: either regulations, customer demands, or other commercial benefits. Unless incentives are in place, the development will stall. The regulations must be enforced on an international level to ensure competition on equal grounds.</Para>
              <Para>Further, it is believed that the face-to-face focus group meetings had a positive impact on the common awareness among the shipowners and the SCR manufacturers, creating improved dialog and knowledge transfer between the stakeholders.</Para>

                <Para>Health control beliefs were postulated to be associated with health behaviour.

                <Para>Data from a multicentre cross-sectional study among university students in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany was used (N=3,306). The Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale with three dimensions (one internal and two external) and six aspects of health behaviour (smoking habits, alcohol use, drug consumption, being over-/ or underweight, physical activity, and importance of healthy nutrition) were evaluated. Students with stronger internal locus of control paid more attention to healthy nutrition and displayed a higher level of physical activity. Individuals with a stronger belief in health professionals were less likely to use drugs and paid more attention to healthy nutrition. Furthermore, higher scores in the second external locus of control dimension (beliefs in luck or chance) were associated with a higher likelihood of current smoking, lower physical activity and less attention to healthy nutrition.</Para>

                <Para>Students engaged more strongly in unhealthy behaviour if they believed that luck determines health. In contrast, believing in having control over one’s own health was associated with more healthy behaviour. These findings support the need to consider health control beliefs while designing preventive strategies in this specific population.</Para>

                <Heading>Health control beliefs</Heading>
                <Para>Having control over one’s health has been postulated to have effects on personal health behaviour[<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]. Furthermore, Shapiro et al. proposed that having control is not as important as the belief of having control[<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. This subjective understanding of control beliefs regarding health can be conceptualised in different ways[<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]. The most common approach is the Health Locus of Control (HLOC) construct, which links the individual health behaviour to external or internal factors[<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. The corresponding Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLC) is based on three dimensions: 1. an Internal Locus of Control (ILOC) that considers health as a product of personal decisions and a healthy or unhealthy lifestyle, 2. an External Locus of Control, subdivided into two dimensions: control by chance (Chance Locus of Control, CLOC) (e.g. luck determines health), and 3. control by “powerful others” (Powerful Others Locus of Control, PLOC) (e.g. following advice by authorities determines health)[<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>The HLOC theory suggests that high ILOC is linked to healthy behaviour. In contrast, beliefs in luck (or more general: chance) should increase likelihood of negative forms of health behaviour, because health is seen as independent of personal health behaviour[<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. The control by “powerful others” can be related to a good compliance, but requires directives by the “authority” and its connection to health behaviour is more ambiguous[<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>Empirical studies assessing the links proposed by the HLOC theory are inconsistent in their findings. In general, studies based on larger samples found expected associations[<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>], whereas studies using smaller samples did not[<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]. Furthermore, within the LOC dimensions, findings differed by form of health behaviour, with clearer associations for smoking[<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>] or less physical activity[<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>] than for alcohol consumption[<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>] or unhealthy nutrition[<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>]. Several explanations were proposed for this complex picture[<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>]. First, given the rather weak associations, it is possible that smaller studies did not have sufficient power to detect them. Nevertheless, weak associations which affect the whole population can still be of substantial public health relevance[<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>]. On the other hand, larger studies typically had heterogeneous samples; therefore the observed strength of associations might have been attenuated. Second, within the theory of planned behaviour Ajzen proposed that in order to consider a given health behaviour an individual’s responsibility, the knowledge of the implications of this health behaviour is necessary[<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>]. However, the knowledge of health implications is not universal and cannot be assumed a priori. For instance, about half of the population in a survey in Wales did not consider nutrition to be a relevant factor for their long term health[<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>]. While the above findings were published in 1986, it is likely that lack of health behaviour related knowledge remains a problem. The assumption that lack of knowledge can provide an explanation as to why health control beliefs do not affect behaviour, is supported by the findings from analyses stratifying study samples by educational status and demonstrating stronger associations among those with better education[<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>]. Third, Hunt &amp; Martin suggested that health behaviour can be strongly influenced by habits[<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef>]. However, differences can not only exist across forms of health behaviour with respect to the degree by which they are determined by habits, but also across age groups with regard to how firmly behavioural habits are established</Para>
                <Para>Given these considerations, university students could be a population in which the associations between HLOC and health behaviour and therefore may be particularly interesting for assessing it. University students are in an especially interesting biographic state to newly determine their health behaviour and might experience more freedom in making personal choices about their health behaviour than earlier and later in life[<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>]. In contrast to school-age children, most university students are not dependent on their parents and at the same time do not have to assume the responsibility for their own families. In this period of life, students and young people can explore different life directions and explore own life style choices[<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>]. Furthermore, some forms of unhealthy behaviour such as risky alcohol consumption and illicit drug consumption peak in this age group[<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>Restricting the study population to university students has the advantage of reducing heterogeneity and focusing on healthy, educated persons who are likely to be most aware of the implications of health behaviour[<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef>]. Understanding health behaviour of university students could also open important venues of intervention. For example, health behaviour of students that is linked to “powerful others” health beliefs (PLOC) might be of interest for health campaigns. Only three of the previous studies assessed locus of control among university students[<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>] and only one study examined the association between health beliefs and health behaviour among this specific group[<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>]. The latter study included students from several European countries and therefore there was a higher heterogeneity in the sample, which possibly affected the findings. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess associations between the dimensions of HLOC and health behaviour in a homogenous sample of university students from one country. Germany was chosen by way of convenience, and similar studies are being prepared for other countries in the network of Cross-National Student Health Study[<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>]. It was hypothesized that students with high internal health beliefs will display more healthy behaviour, whereas those with high chance locus of control beliefs will show more unhealthy behaviour. Furthermore, we assumed that high scores in the powerful others dimension will be associated with a higher likelihood of health behaviour in areas that are often topics of health campaigns (i.e. smoking, high alcohol consumption).</Para>

                  <Heading>Sample</Heading>
                  <Para>The dataset used in this analysis originates from a study of health and health behaviour among university students in the most populated federal state of Germany, North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW)[<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>]. This multicentre cross-sectional study was conducted in 2006/2007. Students from 12 (out of 13) universities in NRW and 4 universities of applied sciences (selected randomly out of 25 in NRW) were invited to complete a self-administered questionnaire. This ratio between universities and universities of applied sciences was chosen to match the ratio of 3:1 of students from general and applied universities. The study sample was representative of students in NRW with respect to study duration, nationality and migration background. The proportion of female participants in the study sample was slightly higher compared to females among all students in NRW. Courses were selected partly randomly and partly by convenience, and students were invited to fill out the self-administered questionnaire at the end of a lecture. Initially, a balanced sample of students of natural sciences and social sciences was planned. Due to organisational difficulties and variation in response rates this plan was not fully realised. In the final sample, students of medicine and health sciences, educational sciences as well as sport sciences were overrepresented[<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>].</Para>
                  <Para>Participation in the study was voluntary and anonymous. Students were informed that by completing the questionnaire they were providing their informed consent to participate. They were also informed that they could terminate participation at any point while filling out the questionnaire. The permission to conduct the study was granted by the participating institutions which are listed in the acknowledgments. The response rate varied across the universities between 69.3% and 100% (average 87.9%). The final sample included 3,306 students.</Para>

                    <Para>Health locus of control was assessed by the German translation of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLC) developed by Wallston[<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>]. This scale distinguishes between the “internal” (ILOC), and two external (“powerful others” – PLOC and “chance” - CLOC) dimensions. ILOC refers to the extent that one’s behaviour is responsible for the health or illness of an individual. PLOC describes the ascribed influence by healthcare professionals for personal health and CLOC encompasses the degree to which health or illness depends on chance. The MHLC uses five-point Likert scales measuring the extent to which subjects agree or disagree with the statements (1=strongly disagree; 5=strongly agree). Each of the three dimensions was assessed by three statements regarding the relevant health beliefs (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">1</InternalRef>). For each dimension the sum of items was calculated. A high score indicated a high importance of the locus of control in the given dimension, i.e. the higher the ILOC-score, the higher the importance of ILOC.<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab1">

                  <Para>Descriptive analysis was performed using tabulations by sex. In the next step, multinomial (alcohol consumption, smoking habit, BMI and importance of healthy nutrition) and binary (drug intake) logistic regression were used to assess independent associations between health locus of control and health behaviour. All models were composed of sex and age, and the three HLOC scales as independent variables. For these analyses, the three HLOC scales and age were used as continuous variables and the reported odds ratios correspond to one unit change in dimensions score. Before entering the independent variables in the model, the multicollinearity between independent variables was assessed based on tolerance and VIF coefficients. Standard threshold values (tolerance &gt;0.01) were applied[<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>]. Since only 1% to 9% of the variance of the independent variables were explained by the other variables, no multicollinearity problems were diagnosed. Data analysis was performed using the statistical program SPSS for windows, version 17.0.</Para>

                <Para>More than half of the student sample (52%) were females; the mean age was 23 years (SD = 2.2). 87% of the students were born in Germany. Among the three HLOC scales, ILOC scored the highest with an average of 11.43 (the highest possible value for all scales was 15). The mean values of PLOC and CLOC were similar (7.07/7.15). The scores for HLOC for all three scales differed by sex, with higher scores on average in males than in females. The results are presented in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">1</InternalRef>.</Para>

                <Para>For five of the six aspects of health behaviour there was a difference by sex, with women reporting more healthy behaviour with respect to alcohol, drug use, and nutrition (data not shown). In contrast, women reported lower physical activity than men. In terms of BMI, female students were more likely to be underweight and less likely to be overweight. Current smoking and overweight were more common among older students. In contrast, older students were more likely to pay attention to healthy nutrition.</Para>

                <Para>Results of the regression analyses are presented in Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab3">3</InternalRef>. Higher ILOC was associated with a higher physical activity and a higher importance of healthy nutrition. Higher PLOC was associated with a lower drug use, not paying attention to healthy nutrition and less physical activity during a typical week. Higher ratings in the CLOC dimension were associated with a higher likelihood of being a current smoker, drinking alcohol at least once a day, less physical activity and less attention to healthy nutrition. In terms of explained variation in health behaviour the models displayed rather low values (Nagelkerke’s-R<Superscript>2</Superscript> below 0.1 for most models, apart from the regression models for alcohol consumption as well as the importance of healthy nutrition with the HLOC scales and socio-demographic variables which had a Nagelkerke’s-R<Superscript>2</Superscript> of 0.11), the odds ratios however, indicated strong effects for selected groups. For example, per unit change in CLOC dimension score, the probability of being a current smoker (in comparison to never-smoker) increased by 9%. For the importance of healthy nutrition the probability of “very unimportant” (in comparison to “very important”) decreased by 36% per one unit of ILOC score.<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab3">

              <Heading>Discussion</Heading>
              <Para>In this multicentre survey of students in Germany, the associations between health beliefs and health behaviour were assessed. Among the three studied HLOC dimensions, ILOC had the highest scores, whereas the scores for PLOC and CLOC were nearly equal and much lower. Students reported a frequent consumption of alcohol, relatively frequent physical activity, but a low importance of healthy nutrition. Multivariable analyses showed multiple associations between the HLOC dimensions and selected health behaviour forms: However, these associations differed across the dimensions indicating an importance of a holistic view on health control beliefs.</Para>
              <Para>In general, HLOC scales only accounted for a small fraction of variation in health behaviour, which is in agreement with previous studies in this field[<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>]. However, this finding led to different interpretations in previous research. On the one side, Calnan[<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>] raised doubts about the importance of the HLOC construct and suggested that health behaviour may not be associated with beliefs regarding control of health but rather with concerns over risky health behaviours like smoking or alcohol consumption. On the other side, Steptoe and Wardle[<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>] took a different position and argued that the effects of health control beliefs were rather strong in population terms in contrast to other psychological factors like social support. They also pointed out that correlation measures (and therefore their derivate “explained variance” in linear model or its equivalent in logistic regression) do not convey the public health importance of an association. Explained variation is driven by the effects observed in the vast majority of a population, but still there can be specific characteristics strongly related to specific risk behaviours (for example people with very high scores on PLOC have substantially higher likelihood of being current smokers). Identifying such subgroups can help in the development of targeted interventions[<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>In contrast to some previous studies among working age[<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>] or adolescent samples[<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>], there were fewer associations between the examined forms of health behaviour and ILOC. ILOC was neither associated with a higher likelihood of being a former or current smoker, nor for more frequent drinking, nor for using illicit drugs. However, high ratings on the ILOC scale were associated with an increased chance of more physical activity during a normal week and with paying more attention to healthy nutrition. This is consistent with the theory postulated by Steptoe and Wardle[<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>] that ILOC has stronger effects on health maintenance behaviour (e.g. healthy nutrition)[<CitationRef CitationID="CR33">33</CitationRef>] than on multiply determined risk behaviours (e.g. smoking, alcohol consumption and drug use).</Para>
              <Para>In our study, ILOC was not related to a higher likelihood of being under- or overweight. Adolfsson et al.[<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>] reported significant associations between the two but they focussed on participants in a weight losing programme. In this subgroup, the association with ILOC may be due to the fact that losing weight is to some extent associated with goal attainment. In general, the observed lack of association can be linked to the fact that weight is not a direct outcome of a single aspect of behaviour and therefore the association between health beliefs and weight can be more complex.</Para>
              <Para>For PLOC, our findings with regards to alcohol consumption were in line with data from previous studies among students as well as adults[<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>]. Additionally, our findings indicated an association between PLOC and drug intake. To our knowledge, no other study has evaluated this association. Whereas a positive correlation between PLOC and smoking was found in a population-based study by Bennett et al.[<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>], no association was observed in our study. It could be argued that behaviour with short-term consequences is more affected by PLOC than behaviour with long-term consequences. Alcohol and drug use can be associated with immediate health complaints like injuries, memory loss or sexual harassment that are directly visible for students[<CitationRef CitationID="CR33">33</CitationRef>]. In contrast, students might not feel to be at risk of health complaints due to smoking because smoking does not affect their immediate state of health and related diseases appear in a distant future[<CitationRef CitationID="CR35">35</CitationRef>]. The observation that students with higher CLOC beliefs have higher odds to be current smokers is in agreement with a population-based study in Wales[<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. Frequent alcohol consumption was associated with higher CLOC scores in our study. These results agree with the previous study addressing HLOC in university students[<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>]. Finally, our results regarding the importance of healthy nutrition were in line with another population-based study in Wales[<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>]. In summary, CLOC demonstrated reversed associations to ILOC as expected in the HLOC theory. Interestingly, CLOC was the only HLOC dimension associated with smoking. Given the omnipresent smoking prevention advertisement and increased awareness of consequences of smoking, being a smoker has to be associated with beliefs in chance and vice versa smoking prevention based on fear appeal might not be effective for those with strong beliefs that chance determines their health.</Para>

                <Heading>Strengths and limitations</Heading>
                <Para>The strength of the present study was the large homogeneous sample of students from multiple institutions, but there were also several limitations. The MHLC scale was applied in a reduced form with only three items for each dimension, which was less than in other studies (e.g.[<CitationRef CitationID="CR36">36</CitationRef>]); this may have affected the precision of the measurement. Despite the self-administered questionnaire, there could have been some reporting bias for health behaviour. For healthy nutrition only the importance, but not the actual behaviour was measured and these two concepts may not be equivalent. Additionally, the measurement of smoking habits did not allow a distinction between occasional and regular smokers. Additionally, we included BMI as a measure of health with respect to weight which does not take a person's body fat content into account.</Para>
                <Para>Another limitation was the lack of measurement of the value of health in our survey. Several previous studies concluded that the value of health is a moderator variable with respect to HLOC and health behaviour[<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef>]. However, there are studies which do not confirm this moderator effect[<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>Overall, the sample of the current survey (as a regional sample) is not representative for all students in Germany. Furthermore, the sample differed from the total population of students in NRW in terms of study subjects and gender distribution. This may have had an impact on reported distributions of forms of health behaviour and potentially also on the strength of observed associations. Finally, the cross-sectional study design does not allow for causal inferences.</Para>

              <Heading>Conclusions</Heading>
              <Para>Associations between HLOC dimensions and health behaviour have been shown among university students in Germany. ILOC was associated with health maintenance behaviour. CLOC had impact on more aspects of health behaviour than ILOC. As expected, both dimensions of the external locus of control produced contrasting findings: higher ratings for PLOC were associated with lower risk behaviour, whereas higher ratings for CLOC with higher risk behaviour. These findings support the need to consider distinct dimensions of health control beliefs while designing preventive strategies among students.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">A little over half a century ago the study of history was given a powerful boost when the <Emphasis Type="Italic">Annales</Emphasis> school engaged in studying the economies of past eras. On the basis of archive data a start was made at that time on recreating, piece by piece, a picture of material exchange in order to investigate the distribution of wealth, the growth of institutions and the structure of markets. The result was a more complete understanding of the moving forces of history. Today’s priority is quantitative measurement of non-material processes. Without this our understanding of many phenomena is guesswork, and we can only shrug vaguely when asked for precise forecasting of choices society will face. Until recently attempts to calculate anything in the arts got nowhere because we lacked any halfway usable instruments of measurement, but now internet technologies enable us to tear aside the curtain concealing the quantitative parameters of symbolic exchange. There is nothing to keep us from moving from talk to action apart from a firmly rooted conviction that this is beyond our capacity. If thinking in the humanities moves in this direction it can look forward to a new upward spiral of development: if it does not, it faces stagnation.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The only place substantial progress has been made is in information economics, where it is beginning to be understood that attention is a resource (Herbert Simon). In the process, science is on the verge of introducing quantitative methods in the symbolic field. However, there continues to be a lack of important data about the quantity and quality of information. The quantity can be more or less estimated, but what is to be done about the quality of information? There are no outward signs, professional judgements are scrappy and contradictary, and market indicators can prove deceptive. Science encounters similar difficulties even when merely measuring conventional utilitarian values. These too cannot be coordinated while they are in people’s minds, until they turn up in the marketplace and become manifest through willingness to pay for exchanges, through prices. Symbolic values cannot be measured in this way. For a number of reasons, then, it is not easy to quote them in monetary terms, even if we look to the markets. I have written in detail about this in my book <Emphasis Type="Italic">The Economics of Symbolic Exchange</Emphasis>. As an example, let me recall the paradox of uniform prices, when movies, books and sound recordings of entirely different quality are all sold at the same price. To some extent the value of the symbolic can be arrived at indirectly through calculation of the time, memory and attention which are condensed in a particular text, but this is a tortuous and thorny path which still does not bring the desired clarity. A number of significant factors remain unconsidered, some which precede the exchange (preferences, desires and motivations) and also some which follow from it (emotions, new meanings and satisfaction).</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">It cannot be said that the social sciences ignore exchange processes, or that people in the humanities find it difficult to use the corresponding terminology. Economic historians, for example, sociologists, political scientists and others analyse events using the categories of symbolic gain and loss which motivate interest groups, but these are on a purely verbal level. There is a total absence of numerical quantification of the concept of exchange, and that is the only thing which makes an exchange approach truly productive. When people talk importantly about “exchange”, when they explain so much by it, one would like to know what the stakes are, what is being exchanged for what and in what proportions. Alas, the parities involved in symbolic exchange could not be detected even recently. With few exceptions, data had to be scratched around for and pecked out a grain at a time. There was simply nowhere the data could be found in the necessary quantities. The richest source of information about non-utilitarian exchange was the markets of culture, but what they clarify is mainly what can be detected through monetary indicators. The box office shows us only the tip of the symbolic iceberg, that part which falls within the purview of commerce. This includes antiques, classical music, collectables, and anything else associated with scarcity. The rest, like poetry, goes unconsidered and yet, although free, some of it is priceless. What little we know about the value of leisure and attention is thanks to the advertising markets where these resources are traded more or less transparently for money. It is, however, the exception when money is a relevant indicator of value in the symbolic field.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">It is sometimes possible to derive data indirectly from market indicators by using calculations based on a number of assumptions. Thus, the symbolic value of collecting art can be estimated if we track how far the potential revenue from selling pictures lags behind the return on investing in bonds. We find that canvases appreciate in value over time more slowly than gilts. Collectors are accordingly forfeiting income and their losses can be viewed as payment for the right to enjoy art, a monetary equivalent of the value of collecting. When serfs in Russia were to be punished for their misdemeanours they would be offered a choice between being whipped or paying a fine. This is convenient for the economist because it clearly defines the price of non-acceptance of violence, although our stoical forebears on the whole chose to be whipped. Such distinct tariffs are rare. The markets in sport, medicine, and war also give some understanding of the monetary equivalents of values in the humanities, but it is far from complete. On the whole, money and markets are poor quantifiers of non-utilitarian values.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">As far as identifying the proportions on each side was concerned, symbolic exchange until recently bore no comparison with material exchange. Now, however, its contours are visible and it seems likely that in the near future it will be numerically quantifiable. Social networks on the internet are where the pattern of non-material exchange is to be found. Networks have drawn in a significant proportion of human activity and, importantly, have codified it. Internet groups are an excellent model for researching the whole of society, not only because in many respects they copy real life, but also because the processes which occur in them do not need to be processed: they are already in the form of postings and the structured actions of users. Huge numbers of people leave traces on the internet of what they are doing in their lives, both online and offline. These indicate not only the event and date but also come with emotional colouration which, in third-generation networks, is overtly expressed in ratings and points awarded. This provides an opportunity to measure resources input, for example the time spent on communicating in a social network, and to see the resultant output expressed in the user’s subjective rating. Web 3.0 sites allow us to observe the reaction to actions and objects not only on the internet but also in the outside world. The action occurs in reality, while the consumer’s attitude to it is registered on the site. Internet activity does not, of course, reveal life in all its fullness, but it is an excellent testing ground. From the flow of internet transactions data can be extracted which is of interest to a wide spectrum of sciences like sociology, political science, psychology, cultural studies, art history, linguistics and institutional and behavioural economics. What historians fish out of archives and sociologists from questionnaires will swim of its own accord into nets for researchers to harvest. Possibly the richness of the networks will engender that interdisciplinarity on which so many hopes have been pinned for so long.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Values are in people’s minds and become manifest in the course of exchange. The fuller and more visible the exchange, the more detailed the statistics about acts of exchange, the more clearly will we be able to see what people are prepared to part with in order to acquire a particular good or service.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">At the risk of repeating ourselves, the sole means of measuring values is to place them in conditions of intensive, remunerated exchange, that is a market. Exchange processes in networks are moving towards the market model, but as communications become more dense, and when in the future the internet, television, and telephone communication all converge on a single platform, these exchange processes will occur ever more plainly in accordance with market laws. At the same time, the proportions of symbolic exchange will crystallise out and become particularly evident with the introduction of post factum payments and monetisation of social networks generally. In the Stone Age too it was not immediately clear how many bananas should be exchanged for a clay pot. Having once begun, the calibration of exchange correlations will become irreversible. When even a small part of what we know about material exchange has accumulated, this will have a powerful influence on awareness of tariffs of symbolic exchange and will ricochet to affect the course of actual processes. At this stage the second invisible hand of the market will begin to act, in accordance with fundamentally different principles. Like Adam Smith’s invisible hand, its main driver is data about the observable acts of participants.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Without a doubt, we will shortly learn to extract a mass of useful information from the rich seam of logged human communication on the internet, even if today analysts do not quite know how to approach the task. There is, of course, the highly sensitive question of what we want to learn about people and life from the internet. Users seem to be producing actions, moving like Brownian particles under a microscope, but we are not sure what we should be looking for. This is probably why the predominant research approach is to view users as potential customers. At least this makes it clear who will fund the research. Works on the economics of the internet and social networks, however, can be counted on your fingers. Everything that can be found on this topic was written in the last millennium when networks as they exist today were simply not there. The sociology of social networks has also not advanced far beyond corporative marketing, with its emphasis on delivering targeted sales.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">To summarise, let us return to our principal thesis: everything is now in place for quantitative measurement of symbolic exchange. It is essential to focus the various research forces on the internet, since that is where a convenient bridgehead has appeared for making a breakthrough. Timely as this call undoubtedly is, it will not be enough on its own to move things forward. If exchange is conducted by barter, as it mainly is on social networks, the quantitative parameters we are looking for will be difficult to detect; and if for money, the measurements, as we have already noted, introduce more confusion than clarity. We will next need to resolve the issue of a unit of measurement of symbolic value, without which our intentions will not be fully realisable. We shall return to this a few chapters from now. For the present, though, let us just partly show our hand: symbolic exchange can be represented in numbers by measuring the input and output of what drives it: the transformation of objective time into subjective personal value. A person seeks to exchange the time at his disposal for something which will bring meaning to his existence and evoke a positive reaction in his mental make up, whether by socialising, reading or study. We can characterise this transformation generally by modifying the renowned formula about capital to read: “time–text–time*”, where “*” signifies the increased quality time, and “text” stands for any symbolic product in objective form. In this formula “text” occupies the same place and plays the same role as “money” in Marx’s formula “goods–money–goods”, mediating the transformation of goods into better goods. Just as money accumulates capital in itself, so texts accumulate symbolic capital. Those two kinds of capital can be exploited with variable effectiveness, an understanding of which is facilitated by traditional or symbolic economics respectively. In the social networks the general idea of symbolic exchange assumes concrete form: who is exchanging what with whom, in what proportions, at what moment in time. All this extremely valuable empirical evidence is there, waiting to be collected and analysed.</Para>

            <Heading>Studying Dissemination of Information</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The next major topic after measurement of exchange is the dissemination of information. Of utmost importance in the information society are signals and the mechanisms by which they are spread: their points of origin, their power, their trajectories, their duration and geographical coverage. Understanding the spread of information is even more difficult than measuring exchange, and of equal practical importance. Whereas the correlations to be observed in exchange are by and large static, here, by definition, everything is dynamic. Here too, however, electronic, especially third-generation, social networks offer a new and very promising bookkeeping tool, since the information they contain is both registered and processed in vastly greater detail, while the communications themselves are organised in a more complex manner. By comparison with ordinary networks with their blogger potpourri of actual postings and comments or quotations, a Web 3.0 network contains far more valuable data. There are personalised profiles, collections of ratings behind which a subject with a name and surname is visible, along with his socio-demographic characteristics and consumer history. In brief, there is a full-blown cultural anamnesis. On Web 2.0 sites it is usual for ratings, if they are collected at all, to be confined to a narrow range of topics from which no overall understanding of the user’s preferences can be formed. With Web 3.0, however, each of these reflections comes with a precise date, so that any action can be analysed in the context of other actions, and any rating within a system of other ratings. By monitoring network communications we can detect, for example, the moment and place in society where particular processes appear, who takes them up and why, by which routes and at what speed they spread. This enables us to track the dissemination of social awareness deep inside society rather than relying on the sociological samples or media voxpops which currently have to serve.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">At one time the consumer had the choice of objects with various pluses and minuses, but when a certain level of social prosperity was reached, the social signalling function of objects, how they were perceived by those around, began to outweigh their directly utilitarian functions. Relations between the real and the perceived became more complex until a point was reached where signs became an end in themselves and capable of overshadowing and manipulating realities. They can easily signify something which does not actually exist, or which is at variance with reality. These are so-called simulacra. They are almost given official permission to bear false witness. The same applies to signals: they can refer to non-existent or wantonly interpreted signs, processes or events. (By “signs” we are referring here to something which contains information, and by “signals” to whatever transmits it.) Just as signs can be more important than the actual nature of things, so signals can prove almost more important than the facts they make known. The greater the importance of communications in our lives, the more significant do the treatment and ways of disseminating information become. Often, correctly presented information can be decisive. It programs subsequent behaviour. Signals can be transmitted selectively and interpreted arbitrarily to produce a reaction in the masses not based on an objective understanding and hence difficult to foresee. Networks enable us to track the routes taken by information not in general but individually, literally person by person, and equally individually to register their reaction. In the past there was no way of approaching this problem and, until it could be solved, humanity had no prospect of making progress in its desire to reduce the uncertainty of the future.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">It can be sufficient to show people a new truth about themselves for whole classes to start behaving differently. The material preconditions have to be present, of course, but they are never sufficient on their own; skilled interpretation is more important than anything else, as Marx and Lenin demonstrated in practice. Why confine ourselves to ideology, though? A century and a half ago it took Pasteur decades to inculcate new standards of hygiene. People either believed him or they didn’t, and depending on that they washed or did not wash their hands. If convictions were that important in Pasteur’s non-ideological issues, which were a matter of life and death, how influential must they be in the New Economy where mind is so plainly influential over matter. Attitudes towards youth, age, beauty, charity, the upbringing of children, contemporary art, money-lending, dissidents and so on all result from work on consciousness, to some extent purposeful and in the service of particular interests, and to some extent spontaneous and not specifically managed by anybody.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">For example, attempts are being made in developing countries to establish the boundaries of a middle class, which is seen as promoting stability and prosperity. An effective move would be to devise the portrait of this stratum in such a way as to include as many social groupings as possible. A mere reclassification by the media would allow people who believed themselves poor to take a step up the ladder in their own eyes and would thereby help them on to the strait and narrow path of consumerism. Teachers drag hopeless pupils tottering on the verge of failure up into the next class in the knowledge that they have only to believe in themselves for a powerful updraft to be engaged, which will grow even more powerful as they approach a goal which had initially appeared unattainable. Inner motivation is the key to understanding the effectiveness of signals, even when they are flattering or deceptive. Where there is information competition, everything depends on who proves more convincing and whose initiative is taken up first. A signal given at the right moment programs expectations and these materialise in a willingness to rally round particular initiatives, to contribute or withhold one’s energy (vote), and accordingly to influence the outcome. People feel a need to take their place in processes where what matters most is not “what?”, but “who with?”.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">At the present time we know in only general terms about the dissemination of information in society. This does not let opinion-formers of various kinds off the hook of being expected to manage social perception. To a large extent they are flying by the seat of their pants and naturally make mistakes in abundance. There is no point in blaming anybody for this, since people always have a measure of freedom which introduces unpredictability into how they will react to a particular message. For example, in a period of financial crisis you need to be certain, when deciding whether to inject money into the economy, that citizens will increase consumption and not just decide to hoard resources for a rainy day. Alas, a government can only guess because there is no unambiguous advice in works on macroeconomics. Even less are there hints on how to nudge public reaction in the desired direction. We cannot boast even a framework for understanding dynamic information processes. Public opinion can turn one way or the other depending on how information is presented. A barrage of unfavourable commentaries, and even what seem to be the most reasonable decisions, taken in full accordance with available theory, may have the opposite effect to what was anticipated. Then again, moves which the same theory suggests are highly unpromising may prove successful.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Judging by the relatively smooth course of the 2008–2009 crisis, jobbing economists have been able to put out the seats of the fire. The Russian government selectively helped national corporations to settle with their foreign creditors, saving them from facing “margin calls” (a forced sale of securities at knockdown prices). Public perception of the move tended to be negative. Supporting favourites with state funds when others were not provided with similar resources was indeed morally questionable. Nevertheless, these and a number of other demonstrative measures, signalling firm if not fully implemented intentions, produced the desired results. Bankers took note of the signal and did not start demanding the repayment of debts as vigorously as they might have. The threatened avalanche of margin calls was successfully averted.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Politics is largely a matter of management through the creation of legends and leaks. That is what it does, getting the millstones to grind with a minimal input of effort. The theory of how this works is embryonic, but elaborating it would enable us in future to reduce the role of political instinct and improve the quality of calculation. At present the dissemination of information is at best something going on in people’s minds. Serious modelling is far beyond our current capability and only game theory is working on this. In public debate about the failure of a particular project we never hear mention of the dissemination or lack of it, reliability or lack of it, or the fullness or lack of it of information. The reason is only too obvious: a lack of theoretically grounded arguments. There is not even any halfway accepted vocabulary current in society to ensure that the whole area is not regarded as pure hocus-pocus. The result is that complex matters are outrageously simplified, with no account taken of important factors. That is damaging. While everything is at this level of tight-lipped oniscience we can only passively observe the swirling of the great sea of events in society. By and large, nobody will be able to make any sense of either minor upsets or global social cataclysms. We will have to make do with commentary with the benefit of hindsight.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Precise, systematic data about the dissemination of information can be extracted from Web 3.0 social networks and, as of now, from nowhere else. Not, at least, in the quantities we are looking for. Researchers face a number of difficulties as they wrestle with multiple interconnections between reality, attitudes towards reality, and information about those attitudes. The superimposition of accretions of differing levels of complexity will afflict them with that same sense of never being able to get a handle on anything as affected the philosophers of the School of Athens.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The situation is reminiscent of the spy game “I know that you know that I know…”, which even game theory seems unable to get to grips with. This is especially the case in practical instances when it really is not known who is informed to what extent about what other participants know. For all that, no matter how intricate the game appears, it is never too difficult to be mastered by the strongest players, who are able to see through weaker partners. For all its labyrinthine complexity, the system is not unfathomable. Two seams can be separated out: the views or standpoints which directly determine actions, and what influences those views.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">We are primarily interested in one, possibly the most important, aspect of this influence which derives from the group nature of the structure of society. People initially react to new facts (or what they are told about them) to the extent that they impinge on their own private interests. In the course of subsequent private and public communications, individual positions become aggregated and adapt themselves to group platforms. It is important to understand how and why this happens. Personal interests alter both as a result of new understanding of a situation, but also as a result of observing which platforms are most rapidly acquiring supporters and becoming viable. There are two crucial influences at work here. The first is which facts are made public and how they are presented, what is made made known and what is kept quiet. The second, and most important, is how much information people have about the potential number of supporters particular interest groups have which they might consider joining, and also how many supporters the groups currently have and how fast their ranks are growing. As regards the filtering of information, the principle is well enough understood because a number of stratagems have long been in use for manipulating society’s choices. Nevertheless, how the information cascade operates and the pathways it follows remain unknown. In order to understand how people act in particular circumstances, we need to know not only their attitude to those circumstances and their assessment of the likely final relative strength of various forces, but also the information they had when they made their decision and the extent to which they were following the herd. Figuratively speaking, what odds are they anticipating when they gamble on a particular group winning? This question is similarly posed in game theory.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The inversion of Marx’s dictum to read “consciousness determines being” (or analogously, “mind over matter”) has become a commonplace frequently used in discussions of mind games where thinking is unfettered by logic. But what determines mind? For as long as the informational substratum in which personal and social principles mature remains unresearched, the phrase “consciousness determines…”, which appears to explain something, is a mere smokescreen. Until it can be translated into numbers, it will remain as impenetrable as the word “exchange” used to be.</Para>

            <Heading>Modelling Group and Network Effects</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Social networks are bursting with data for the above two research approaches. They have the further useful characteristic of enabling the analyst to get out of his study into real social fieldwork without suffering the usual associated stresses and strains. As traditionally practised, investigations in the field raise endless problems: the selection of representative groups, elimination of obstructions and “noise”, correct formulation of questions, optimisation of data collection costs, and so on. In a collaborative system much of this is no problem at all.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The social sciences peer into the future by extrapolating from the past. Ideas about tomorrow are projections from reconstructed histories, motivations and institutions of yesterday. A different approach tries to establish people’s current attitude to something and attempt a forecast on that basis. Both paths are imperfect, as marketologists bringing new products on to the market know, and as those who commissioned their research know even better and to their cost. It is futile to survey putative consumers as to whether they will like some as yet unknown ware and what it should be like to make them like it. How would people have reacted to someone who forecast the popularity of Tamagotchi virtual pets or ringtones? Novelties wow the world without needing any pre-existing demand.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The methods of social prediction currently in use have more than a few shortcomings. Interviewees fantasise about what they might want if they were subject to no limitations and could ignore the cost of their answer. Some of the sharp corners can be avoided or smoothed over if the fieldwork is meticulously prepared, although few people actually have the energy to do this. With the traditional approach, however, there always remains an insuperable obstacle: a person interviewed individually or in a group is not the same person as he will be when acting in a real human environment. The circumstances in which they are talking to the interviewer have little in common with those in which they will act in the future. The main thing missing when answers are gathered by interview is that only as matters progress does it become clear what the group norm is going to be, how actions are going to fit with social pressures and social acceptability. Real-life behaviour takes its cue from leaders and trends and the attitude of people from one’s own circle towards them. This dimension cannot be modelled in a research laboratory. An individual or small-group based result when projected on to the actual behaviour of large numbers of people can have an unanticipated margin of error sufficient to change a plus to a minus. This is the Achilles’ heel of all experiments conducted with conveniently available human resources, whether the students of a particular professor or a different cohort. The effect is quietly passed over, but deprives the results of the greater part of their credibility. Results obtainable from a small group are not representative because of the group and network effect. They may differ startlingly from the behaviour of a large community because social solidarity has a decisive effect on the dissemination and perception of information, providing an external source of motivation. Ignoring this in experiments is tantamount to researching a tornado in a glass of water.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">It is not that in large-scale social networks on the internet this very basic problem can be avoided: it simply does not and cannot exist. Collective action can be investigated there in its vast natural dimensions, not crammed into laboratory conditions. The experimental world merges with the practical world, something one could only dream of in the past.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Let us move on from these generalising remarks about methodology to examples of research which can be conducted within social networks, and let us begin with an instance which clearly shows up the limitations of traditional methods.</Para>

          <Heading>(Un)Happiness Economics</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">A serious hindrance for economic policy and economics generally is the lack of relevance of data collected by traditional methods. This is particularly noticeable when, for example, there is a need to correlate the state’s economic strategy with how people are going to feel after it has been implemented. Governments do not control the quality of life either completely or directly. They can only bring about improvements in certain aspects, but which are the right economic goals and which are wrong? Which goals will citizens be grateful to see achieved? Economists need to set the overall direction of economic development so as to increase the perceived quality of life. They also need criteria to enable them to track how effective the political line chosen is proving, and to make comparisons between different countries.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">On the level of common sense and common parlance, outlining the ideal towards which we should be striving might not seem all that difficult, but in fact devising workable criteria proves exceptionally difficult. The traditional approach is to identify the most important components of living: the basics, like food, accommodation, heating, clothing; then socio-cultural and educational standards; medical care; and the appropriate level of political and economic freedom. A system of quality indicators is then elaborated for each group. Most widely used is the Human Development Index (HDI) which brings together the features of life expectancy, quality of education and real GDP per capita of the population. Whether using the HDI’s methodology or any other there are difficulties in devising a unitary indicator making it possible to synthesise fundamentally different features and to reflect real life convincingly. A first stumbling block becomes apparent with the effort to decide what to include in the system of indicators, and what to leave out as being too difficult to quantify. These are very evident in the educational and cultural parameters. If income and life expectancy can be calculated fairly accurately, there is no simple solution for assessing quality of education or religious freedom. Even if we could measure everything agreed to be appropriate, how are the heterogeneous parameters and logics to be reduced to a final index. Estimating the appropriate weighting is the next greasy pole. When at last, despite all these difficulties, we have a system, admittedly burdened with compromises, a final problem arises as to how to deal with the heterogeneous distribution of goods between people. Economists and politicians have average values at their disposal, but how are they to be interpreted if that quantity of goods is not available to a majority of the population? The HDI has been published since 1990 and, despite its shortcomings, is regarded as a useful checklist. In practice, however, discussion is usually restricted to the more workable index of Gross National Product per head of the population. In other words, the conclusion is that the more goods and services there are in circulation, the better.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Right, then: economists judge a country’s development on the basis of Gross National Income (GNI), the Human Development Index, or some other complex of measurable indicators. We need to understand that all these methodologies work better where there is a long way to go before basic needs are satisfied, that is, in poor countries, since many aspects of life there are closely linked to Gross National Income. As regards the “Very High Human Development” states (in the HDI rating these are the top several dozen countries), the weighted indicators balanced there are clearly unsatisfactory because the existential pulse of the society is overlooked. It can be that, despite thoroughly enviable ratings, people feel awful (as we can see, for example, from the decadent mood showing through the cosmetic mask of feature movies). To try to equate rank in the HDI ratings with how a country’s citizens feel is the equivalent of judging a play’s quality by the amount of scenery and stage props it has.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">We can try to deduce the quality of life from the indices, but alternatively we can directly measure subjective satisfaction with life and see how closely it matches the indices. This is a way of checking the efficacy of the indices and making adjustments to them. Indicators are of value only to the extent that they help us to make people happier, which is what happiness economics attempts to do. This is a subdivision of economics which since the 1970s has been studying the correlation between objective indicators and how people actually feel. Respondents are asked directly whether they are satisfied with their life or not. The questionnaire data suggest that a sense of well-being is linked less closely to economic indicators than is commonly believed. This seems particularly to apply once a tolerable standard of living has been achieved. In different countries this ranges from US$200 to $1,200 per person per month. Below this level an increase in income has a clear positive impact on satisfaction, mainly because of a decrease in the sense of unhappiness which arises from feeling defenceless and oppressed by living in straitened circumstances. Above this level the satisfaction curve all but ceases to rise. This chimes in with data obtained from the sociology of labour and, in particular, with research into the motivation of managers. At first material recompense stimulates people to throw themselves into their work, but this stops when a certain income level is reached. It does, admittedly, restart much further up the scale, but only at very high bonus levels. In other words, although people believe that the more money a person has the better, that “better” may not be so significant as to justify the additional effort needed to earn it. If people are not hungry and already have communications facilities, then being provided with more tinned tomatoes or telecommunications will not make them much happier. This suggests that the picture obtained from lists based on economic parameters may differ from what people are actually feeling as greatly as a snapshot taken in a photo booth differs from a photographic portrait.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Although this assertion seems very obvious, actual economic policy ignores it. It carries on as if there were no lack of correlation between what it achieves and what people perceive. Intuition suggests, however, that the gap may be very wide indeed and that consequently this is an issue requiring to be studied. If our suspicions are correct, there is a need to amend both the indicators and the policy.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Numerous surveys have shown that an increase in income cannot be directly converted into an increase in happiness. There are a whole variety of reasons for this, of which the most obvious is that what matters to a person is not the absolute level of goods they possess, but that the level should be rising. The process of improvement rejoices the heart almost more than the result. People become accustomed to the level of well-being they have achieved and begin to regard it as no more than their due. They need to see improvement, but the better the situation they find themselves in the more difficult it is to achieve perceptible improvement. Gossen’s law of the diminishing marginal utility of goods partly applies also to a complex of goods. It is to the merit of economists that this is taken into account when calculating HDI. A result is that people feel they are stagnating. They don’t feel good. This is why it is no bad thing for the process to proceed smoothly and for improvements to take place over an extended period. Contentment is thereby prolonged.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">A second, more subtle, consideration is that if we represent the correlation between contentment and objective improvements with a graph, the curve will resemble a flower petal leaning to one side. In science this form is called a hysteresis loop. Upward movement along this curve is delayed, while downward movement is accelerated. If there are swings of well-being upwards or downwards, the positive or negative part of the amplitude by which the emotions swing do not coincide. In other words, losses make people comparatively sadder than analogous gains make them happy. It is preferable for the rise to be steady and without fluctuation, even if that means there are no great leaps forward. If there are dips, there will be net emotional losses in the hysteresis.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">This emotional asymmetry in perceiving life’s ups and downs has a consequence which is not immediately obvious. Since there are many parameters of quality of life and not all of them will be rising at the same time, a hitch anywhere may subjectively outweigh all the gains, even if they have been achieved on many fronts. The system of weighted indicators takes no account of this, but it should. Recalculating these “downs” to their true weight can radically alter the picture.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">To be completely accurate, we should also mention that events which occur less frequently evoke a hypertrophic emotional reaction. A kind of trigger operates which scales emotions up or down depending on how frequently they occur. For relatively well endowed societies success is the norm and unpleasantness is relatively rare. This means that success evokes a modest positive reaction while unpleasantness produces a sharply negative one. Those living in certain poor countries demonstrate the opposite. Their governments find it relatively easy to make their subjects, whose lives are hard, happy by tossing them a crust from time to time. People get inured to misfortune. They react less sensitively to what is just the latest disaster. At the same time they are pleased by small things. Mechanisms of emotional adjustment kick in which mitigate inequality in standards of living, blunting or sharpening perception of more frequent or rarer occurrences. The psychological metabolism of the individual and the society maintain a stable proportion of the positive and the negative and it is quite difficult to produce a relative shift from a level which has become established. We might even half seriously propose a law of conservation of happiness analogous to the law of conservation of energy. Empirical data is presented in Appendix 1 in support of this.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Mechanisms of emotional asymmetry benefit the poor and from this a number of conclusions follow in respect of policy aiming to overcome inequality. Giving priority to the initial phase of gains will target that sharply rising part of the satisfaction curve where the first small results give a marked increase in the feeling of good fortune. There should really be an area of happiness economics called unhappiness economics or, more precisely, “anti-unhappiness economics”, to teach us how to climb out of unhappiness. Let those who are protected from major disasters worry about happiness. The more so since the surveys show how difficult it is to get happiness right. You can’t just turn on a tap.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Interesting effects apply also to the well-off. Gossen’s law of decreasing marginal utility of goods, including a totality of goods, operates as a brake on happiness, but where a complex of goods is concerned it is only partly applicable. Decreasing levels of satisfaction are obtained from collections of goods where their overall consumption does not produce a cumulative effect, but collections can be assembled in which there is a far greater increase in value than arises from each constituent in isolation. This applies to socio-functional consumption like education and creativity, or when a transition to a higher quality is ripening and needs only a little more to make it happen. Then, despite Gossen’s law, an anomalous upsurge of satisfaction is observable. This rule, together with emotional hysteresis, modifies the happiness curve. It normally levels off, but here the graph looks different. Upon achieving a certain level of economic prosperity the indicators can soar upwards. This cumulative increase of value is exceptionally important in the New Economy. Traditional economics, both in theory and in practice, has a blind spot here, with the result that to date it has rarely been used effectively.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">A further known cause for a discrepancy between indicators of quality of life and the individual’s sense of well-being is comparison with those around you, your immediate circle. If GDP is rising, it is doing so for almost everybody at the same time with the result that there is an insufficient change in a particular individual’s rating in comparison with his neighbours to generate a surge of positive emotion. By extension, a comparator which is remote in time or space is felt less keenly (except for comparison with our own youth, with all the accompanying embellishments of memory). On the whole, comparison with flourishing Danes or impoverished Papuans does not have much effect on how Russians feel (except perhaps about the glories of European socialism as depicted in the media, which we might find less palatable in reality.)</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Summary indices, then, are far from summarising everything they should. There can be minuses left outside the brackets which are capable of cancelling the observed pluses. These include such things as work-related stress, anxiety about the future, the breakdown of family values, the loneliness of the big city, and culturally inspired problems with ageing and appearance. The reverse is also possible, where minuses are taken into account but not the pluses. A country may be a world leader, for example, in devising laws and standards to regulate complex, ambiguous issues like cloning, euthanasia, chemical stimulation of the brain, gay marriage, the treatment of domestic animals, problems of copyright, and receive no credit in the index for experiments which the whole world follows with interest.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The system of indicators appears to give no credit to North Americans for their unparalleled legal constructs regulating sexual harassment, consumers’ rights, or the protection of children. It may be far in the future before this receives its deserved recognition. There are whole areas which have a marked effect on happiness but where objective indicators, including financial indicators, are sure to work badly. These include culture in the broad sense and cultural consumption in a narrow sense.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Although happiness economics operates with information obtained directly from people, and in consequence puts itself forward as almost a Supreme Court in respect of indices, its own methodology is not beyond reproach. There are difficulties in defining the moment in time for which the survey results can be considered valid. Obviously there can be delayed effects not evident at the time of the research, so that the results can never be regarded as final. Intensive economic growth, which inclines people to rate positively, goes hand in hand with emotional exhaustion and underinvestment in cultural capital. Everybody is pursuing money, but without a proportionate increase in symbolic capital the higher degrees of satisfaction will not be attained. Rapid growth additionally takes a bite out of the next generation’s quota of happiness by pushing up the bar of expectations and engendering a dangerous split between the ideal and reality, between what young people aspire to and what they can realistically hope for. Children suffer the consequences of a misconceived parental sense of duty which aims to create favourable conditions for them but simultaneously eats away at the potential for them to enjoy achievements of their own. It is no longer the case that “children are where nature takes its holidays”. Instead children take their holidays in accordance with human nature, and the older generation by allowing them to live with everything provided deprives them of the incentive to be energetic. The trajectory of a prosperous society is often likened to going up a staircase which leads downwards. That is not mere words, although it might be more accurate to liken it to trying to run up the down escalator. The pace achievable by the fittest and most successful members of society may be beyond the reach of the majority. Meanwhile the leading social groupings, maintaining their distance from the rest, shielding themselves from a sense of stagnation, continue like meths addicts to rush to new highs. But for them, as for all the others, this leads to a psychological overloading which can cancel out everything that has been achieved, as is signalled by the highly developed industry of psychotherapy. Every dollar it earns should be multiplied by 100 (if not by 1,000) and deducted from the measure of GDP.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Economics cannot really be reproached for failing to increase happiness, since the area it is responsible for is not happiness but development. If the indices are reflecting anything, it is not happiness but the provision of conditions in which a person may discover themselves, enjoy freedom to choose and surmount their circumstances. It is the complexity, the satiety and diversity of life. That is why they are called development indices. We would have far more justification for judging the validity of indices by subjective feelings of satisfaction, as happiness economics does, if people associated happiness primarily with personal freedom, but it is only a few individuals who see things in that light. Freedom and complexity are an inseparable couple, with the result that by no means everybody is free and happy at the same time (just as not all who are unfree are unhappy).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">A further compromise inevitably present in happiness surveys is caused by the difficulty people face in attempting to summarise how their life feels over a longer period of time. This is why the rating of a calendar year will be heavily dependent on whether the question is asked when the interviewee is going through a good or a bad patch. A further element of randomness finds its way into responses from the fact that the present is not a unity but structured in three-part blocks of experience which include memory of the past, the present as experienced at a given moment, and the future as it is envisaged. It is uncertain which of these elements will be selected by the introspective eye, which emotions a person will voice during the survey.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The next problem arises because it is easier to rate something if you have something to compare it with; that is, if a person can simultaneously measure several comparable acts or periods against each other. On a recommendation site the users rate movies, celebrities, hotels, mobile telephones, and much else, but there is a knack to this apparently straightforward procedure. After rating several dozen or several hundred objects you may suddenly realise that you initially gave too high a rating to something right at the beginning, which has resulted in unfairness to objects experienced later. For example, you may have impulsively awarded “10” on a 10-point scale, only to come across something better. This is why judges of aesthetic forms of sport hold back the top scores for only the most outstanding performances. Because people feel the need to rerank their impressions, they should have an opportunity to review their ratings at any time. Overall ranking with the aid of paired comparison analysis is a rational algorithmic procedure which gives good results, but does not work in the relatively infrequent happiness surveys because people in most cases have nothing to compare.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">To conclude: happiness surveys are not entirely harmless. Having once given voice to his rating, a person will start believing what he has said. It becomes a fact of his existence. It is entirely possible that the Russian habit of denigrating all things Russian is a reaction to an alarmingly low position in ratings. For all their drawbacks, happiness surveys are undoubtedly useful, but no matter how far their results diverge from and discredit traditional indices, economic policy will continue to be based on the latter. Governments, as indeed their peoples, tend to press on regardless in order not to look worse than others, even though it might only be necessary to re-adjust the measurement procedures to make life in a number of countries seem not to be all that dismal at all. The problem all along may just have been that those states were competing under rules ill-suited to them. It is much like entering a long-distance runner in a sprint and then disparaging his performance. When they find themselves in a similar position, nations may engage in excessive self-excoriation, develop inferiority complexes and even follow someone else’s path, when in fact the problem lies in the way the scores are toted up. They should be glad to have the advantages of those who are catching up because they have a potential for improvement which the leaders may already have exhausted. No less importantly, they have the opportunity of learning from other people’s mistakes and taking shortcuts. The leaders too have their problems if they allow themselves to be mesmerised by the indicators, pedal faster and faster, and finally collapse in exhaustion.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Vaulting ambition led to the world financial crisis of 2008–2009. In pursuit of raising a partly fictitious quality of life, labour resources were overstrained. Some found themselves incapable or unwilling to work more intensively in order to consume more. This revealed the Achilles’ heel of the New Economy with its focus on desires. An excess of goods poured off the conveyor belt, many of which could have been dispensed with without causing any real hardship. At the first serious setback customers sobered up and the mirages which, with the assistance of marketing consultants, filled their heads vanished in an instant. It became clear that a whole range of goods were not essential for personal happiness, especially when those around were tightening their belts without evident ill effects. Many cut back on consumption, dealing a cruel blow to manufacturers who found themselves working in a very sluggish market. Initially economic agents do not know which part of the assortment should be reduced and by how much, which causes them to panic. Uncertainty about the production plan spills over into uncertainty about jobs and investment. As there is no way of knowing which new business projects will be profitable tomorrow, they don’t get off the ground, while those that have are frozen. This means the capital invested in them is neutralised, while credit liabilities crush borrowers. Immense resources have been put in play to keep ahead of desires, all those third and fourth houses and cottages by the river which were going to be lived in for 1 or 2 weeks a year at most.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">An economy, designed to anticipate every trend in consumption, had only to falter in one place. As soon as this became widely known, manufacturers were petrified as the new climate sent business plans into negative territory. Humanity’s baggage of desires, entirely manageable only yesterday, was suddenly too heavy to carry. The balance between anticipated utility from imagined goods and the frenzied pace of work needed to pay for them no longer correlated. No conventional indices reveal disjunctions of that kind. Data from happiness surveys might have signalled that something was wrong, but even they were no help in warning where the threat was coming from.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">We can expect a radical improvement in prediction if we can organise systematic measurement of satisfaction levels and adjust indicators of social well-being accordingly. This is entirely realistic, bearing in mind that collaborative social networks are literally one step away from being able to provide the primary data required. They will enable us to move from sporadic survey campaigns, with all their inaccuracies, to a workable reflection of the quality of subjective time. It is a major plus for social networks that people use them for their own purposes and have no interest in observation and prediction. They register their own consumer experience (without which they cannot obtain recommendations), and as a result create detailed reports of their feelings about life. The data is collected routinely, without requiring a special effort. A subjective picture of well-being is deduced from the ratings accumulating in the database, which is more complete and more precise than that obtained by using offline surveys. The “respondent” is not placed in an artificial situation where his judgements are slewed by the fact of the survey itself. He does not answer questions about happiness but is engaged in something quite different. He gives his ratings as routinely as he makes his purchases and is not in the least interested that, by representing the demand side, he is activating the invisible hand of the market. If, however, it turns out that the user’s current ratings are mostly positive although he states in happiness surveys that overall everything is terrible, that merely signals that something is wrong with his inner scale. Either he is misinterpreting the realities of his life or he is singing from someone else’s hymn sheet. Possibly, when he looks at his own ratings, he will realise that all this time he was entirely happy. What a relief!</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The difficulty of detecting the substance of happiness prompts us to seek a new language capable of conveying socio-cultural dynamics. The need for this has long been felt. Let the reader not be deterred by the academic phrasing of this issue. It has a direct bearing on everyday life, since being informed, having knowledge and understanding, are synonymous with action in the New Economy. A system of measurement is needed which can detect subtle movements in society dynamically, on the whole accurately, and attached to specific times, strata and groups. We also need an adequate descriptive language to replace that jingling of the fool’s bells of populism which reduces a complex system of factors to primitive dilemmas, after which everybody just tries to see who can shout loudest. The third-generation internet is an environment where there is no need to dumb down and simplify because this is where the quality of subjective time can be measured. The myriad ratings of consumer actions which accumulate in the database and behind which stands the quality of time, that is the raw material we have been seeking for multi-factor dynamic analysis. Every judgement is attached to a time, to personal data, and to a clearly defined event. Any act of consumption takes its place within a series of other actions performed by a particular person, and each rating can be analysed not in isolation but within the system of his experience of life. This manifest connectivity was effectively inaccessible to researchers, but now, with the right tools at their disposal, the humanities will be able to take the next step forward.</Para>

          <Heading>Measuring Happiness</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Traditional economics engages mainly in a struggle against imbalance, scarcity, and inequality because these are the cause of many misfortunes. If, however, there should ever be an end to the hardship of material existence then, as Schopenhauer prophesied (and not only he), the place vacated by the battle against them will be taken over by boredom. Overcoming this anticipated misfortune is a matter for the new economy. Its fundamental concern is to engage people in something meaningful at a time when the most acute problems have been solved and interesting forms of activity are in abundant supply. Admittedly, many of them will not suit everybody. For example, not everybody has the skills to be a writer. What might a positive programme of happiness look like?</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The fundamental message I would like to convey is that the ultimate function of the New Economy is to build up interpersonal communications. It is not to plot against homo sapiens, who has been transformed in recent times first into homo economicus and then, in our days, increasingly been demoted to the lowly status of homo consumerensis. Opponents of the consumer society claim that this metamorphosis is occurring at the behest of capital which requires ever greater volumes of consumption in order to sell its products. The true mission of the New Economy is to create conditions for the self-discovery of each and every one of us. This can be achieved by constructing and servicing groups catering for a great variety of demands. Collaborative filtering facilitates both. While the New Economy concentrates mainly on providing goods for already identified groups, the collaborative system will help to bring people together in groups and then provide for them to interact. The precondition for this is collection of users’ ratings or opinions, on the basis of which like-minded people can be identified and recommendations generated. Ratings are so interesting because they characterise both the consumption of products and those consuming them. These are aspects of a judgement about the quality of time a particular individual spends consuming a particular good or service. They enable us to derive indicators of happiness. We have only to summarise ratings of the time various people spend over a given period. The collaborative system is an already existing tool for measuring happiness.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">No matter how one defines happiness, a correlation is clearly to be traced with positive experience of time. Without straining credibility, we can associate the two, whether happiness is accumulated piece by piece, like a mosaic, or whether it is spontaneous and all-embracing, as if a gift from above. When a person has many positively tinged intervals of time behind, in the present, and ahead in their life we can judge their lot to be a happy one. The greater the proportion of highly rated time and the less low rated time there is, the happier the person. In mathematical terms, the quantity of happiness is the integral of a person’s quality time. For a number of reasons the person himself may determine this integral very inaccurately. If every fragment of life without exception could be rated, the sum of the ratings would characterise happiness perfectly. For the present, to obtain totally complete data is not an option. Indeed, it is unattainable in principle, and it is not actually needed. It is enough that, as recommender practice expands into new areas, quantitative indicators will accumulate. With time the map of subjective satisfaction will be sufficiently detailed to serve for practical purposes. In a number of respects it is already perfectly usable thanks to the millions of users of recommendation sites who systematically rate the movies and plays they have seen, books they have read, and so on. In so doing they have documented an appreciable proportion of their cultural activity and, in order to understand how it influences the sense of happiness, we have only to multiply the assessments by the length of time involved. Such calculations are not difficult, given that the duration of particular types of cultural consumption is fairly standard. For simplicity’s sake, we will disregard the effects of post-experience and aftertaste. We can thus weight the proportion of cinema, theatre, music and reading. Let us suppose that over the course of a year a person has watched 200 movies and the distribution peak of the ratings he has given is “8”. From this we may deduce that the cinema industry has presented him with some 300 h of, by his own criteria, extremely high quality time. If, after five theatre visits he has not once come away with impressions deserving more than a “5”, which signifies “average”, then he has misspent 15 h and they should be subtracted from his symbolic income. On this simple example we can see the kind of practical use which can be made of observation of ratings. Either he should stop going to the theatre, accepting that in its current state it is not to his taste, or he should take greater care about the productions he chooses (perhaps making better use of the recommender service).</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The very first analysis of data extracted from ratings promises to yield new knowledge. For example, if we measure volumes of quality time and extrapolate it per head of the population in areas like cinema, literature and music as far as is currently practicable, we will be able to establish the current norm of happiness. In addition, from the ratings statistics we will be able to derive directly the distribution of personal time and money budgets between different types of leisure, and to study for each individual the conversion rates of objective time into quality time. It will also be possible to compare the financial cost of different ways of achieving the same degree of satisfaction or, from the opposite angle, to establish differences in the quality of time acquired for a particular level of expenditure. If, for example, it is made generally known that movies and shows on free access TV channels on average rate 2 points lower than those on pay services, the number of subscribers to the latter will increase. Such are some of the ways we can work with the statistical data which accumulate in a Web 3.0 system. There is more detailed discussion of this in the Appendix.</Para>
          <Section2 ID="Sec7_3" OutputMedium="All">
            <Heading>Measuring Subjective Time</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Since we are giving so much prominence to subjective time, let us consider the concept carefully and define it as intrapersonal experience of objective time. A very important characteristic of inner time is a person’s subjective estimate of how much time passed while he was engaged in something and not looking at his watch. There is a lot of evidence to indicate that perceived (psychological) time and objective (chronological) time do not necessarily coincide and that, moreover, depending on his emotional state, a person may underestimate or overestimate the length of time which has elapsed by a factor of several times. Chronological time flows evenly, so what is happening to it in the human mind? The greatest intellects have grappled with this question, beginning with St Augustine who associated inner time with a distension of the soul, and continuing with Immanuel Kant and Henri Bergson. The same interest permeates the writings of Marcel Proust, James Joyce, and others. Not only poets and thinkers, but all of us occasionally catch ourselves thinking that time is flowing anomalously and that our inner chronometer is out of sync with the hands of the clock. When you are eagerly anticipating something, time drags agonisingly slowly, and if you are engrossed in something it flies by.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">There are well known experiments confirming that this inner sense of time is no illusion but an innate human ability. It is a sixth sense (or seventh if you add the sense of balance to the usual five). It is a universal characteristic and everybody’s inner clock can speed up or slow down. This is particularly noticeable if there are no external signals to confirm the passage of time. Test subjects lose their sense of time if they are in caves or immersed in salt baths which deprive the sensory organs of signals. The same effects are observed in subjects under hypnosis, suffering sleep deprivation, or taking narcotic substances. At the end of the nineteenth century it was discovered in Wilhelm Wundt’s laboratory that certain people systematically underestimate the duration of time while others overestimate it. It has also been observed that the perception of time is dependent on the nature of external stimuli. Visual signals of exactly the same duration appear longer than auditory ones. If a period of time is divided into short intervals, it is perceived as having been extended. Short intervals lead to overestimation and long intervals to underestimation. Such experiments are studying the basic human ability to determine duration, and test subjects need to have a balanced state of mind. Emotions are seen as flawing the experiment.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">We, however, are precisely interested in the perception of time in different psychological and emotional states. Subjective time or, as it is called, psychological, inner, personal, or intrapersonal time, differs both from objective chronological time and from the time registered by our biological clocks responsible for the functioning of the vital organs. These second and third kinds of time are not considered here, and we will say nothing about social time. Depending on one’s state of mind, time may be experienced as flowing smoothly or advancing in leaps and bounds, as compressed or extended, full or empty. It proceeds unevenly. It is irregular, multi-faceted and manipulable. None of these features applies to chronological time.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The fact that perceived duration of time correlates directly with the subject’s psychological and emotional state and the kind of activity he is engaged in can act as the starting point for some extremely interesting research. A powerful motivation is the feeling that subjective time is somehow associated with the mysterious quality of human existence, and the hope that time might somehow be tamed. Indeed, if perception of time can vary widely, how can we contrive to extend the boundaries as much as possible? To rule time would be in some measure to surmount the finite nature of individual existence. Like all living things, human beings have an inborn aversion to death, and this is augmented by a culture which elevates the value of life to an absolute. It is not difficult to guess why culture does this, but the thought that this highest good is not bestowed in perpetuity can truly poison human existence. Other cultures had different attitudes to the matter of life and death. The culture of ancient Egypt, for example, did not present the afterlife as being particularly scary. Despite the fact that our attitude to death is dictated by nature, the human mind seems close to understanding how to mitigate or altogether do away with the fear of death.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">We need to rebrand the idea of life, shifting the emphasis from the nominal to the subjective duration of time. If we can move from thinking about gross quantity to net quality the problem will be half solved. The need is to move the hands of the clock from objective time to inner time, and learn to slow them down.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">This is possible because the sensation of time is directly dependent on the experiences with which it is filled. Sergey Rubinshtein formulated the “Law of the emotionally determined assessment of time”. Time, filled with events with a positive emotional connotation, is experienced as condensed. When filled with events with negative emotional connotations it is extended. At first glance this looks very unpromising. What is so great about the fact that positive time flows by quickly? Indeed, if the quality of time and its duration are in inverse proportion, then what you gained by increasing one you would lose by decreasing the other and would end up with no net gain. Fortunately, quite the opposite happens. How long a life lasts subjectively depends on how it is remembered, on post-factum rating of its fullness and duration. William James, the psychologist and founder of pragmatism, said much the same as Rubinshtein: “In general, a time filled with varied and interesting experiences seems short in passing…”. However, James immediately went on to perplex the reader with a paradox: “…but long as we look back. On the other hand, a tract of time empty of experiences seems long in passing, but in retrospect short”. Thus, perception of duration during the process is the exact opposite of what it is after it concludes. A person engrossed in what he is doing keeps no track of time, and accordingly it flows by rapidly. When he comes to recollect it, however, it plays back in his consciousness as having lasted for ages. Similarly, if someone has spent time empty of experiences, instead of living he has merely suffered time’s unbearable slowness. He has nothing to remember other than his own wretchedness. Now everything has been turned upside down: subjective duration is a function which increases in line with the quality of time. Time well spent generally impresses itself in memory as having been full and long lasting, and its contribution to the money box of life has been substantial. As we noted earlier, the integral of quality personal time can be seen as quantifying happiness. Now we can see that it simultaneously indicates subjective duration, which is closely connected with the perceived quality of time. Accordingly, maximising the integral means winning the race against the time nature has allotted us. In this light, living two or three times more intensively is tantamount to living the same amount longer and with better quality. On the other hand, to live with zero intensity is close to not living at all. In other words, in order to live a long life, we need to fill the years we have as fully as possible with experiences. This process is something anyone can manage since no abnormal sensitivity is required to recognise the interconnection between the emotional colouration of time, its intensity, and its perceived duration. Most people are capable of this, which means that if they so wish they should not find it particularly difficult to master this kind of self-regulation.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The link between time and the emotions has been confirmed many times experimentally, and also by clinical research. Manic patients greatly underestimate the duration of present time, while people in depressive states overestimate it. The experience of time differs markedly between well-adjusted and maladjusted adolescents. For the latter, the passage of time is empty and unengaging. They look to the past, not the future. The same is observed in people who are chronically stressed.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">From the above we would seem to have arrived at a handy recipe for increasing the effective duration of life: we should just do all we can to fill our time and to keep our mind and soul busy. Unfortunately, this is not a practical recipe but mere wishful thinking, which it will remain unless we can devise a way of bringing the whole idea down to earth by proposing a generally accessible method. Psychology explains a lot about subjective time, but gives no instructions on how to optimise it. At this point we can turn to the concept of personal time elucidated by K.A. Abulkhanova-Slavskaya. She advises that the recipe for true longevity is to live “deeply”. She talks about the “quality of personal time” and links it to self-realisation. This may sounds like a truism, adding nothing to the familiar concepts of “having a good time” and “quality of life”. As soon as a person begins to track subjective time and register their attitude to it, however, the situation changes radically. The term “quality” takes on a specific meaning and practical sense. In order to advance to the management of personal time it is necessary only to distinguish gradations of quality, to document them and be guided by those standards (as yet undefined). These elements are not included in Abulkhanova–Slavskaya’s concept, but her conclusion is that we need to give priority to timeliness, by which she means filling time in the best way possible in the given circumstances. (Let us note that this wish is formulated in full accordance with economic logic.) The problem is that it is no easier to define a measure of timeliness than to define the parameters of quality. Merely replacing one clarion call with another will not move us forward. A separate issue is indicators of human time: they need to be simple and to fit readily into everyday routine. What is the point of characteristics which can only be measured in a specially equipped laboratory? Of course, neither is it any use proposing indicators unless we can persuade people to use them.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In a word, what is needed is regular rating of the quality of subjective time and an easy way of registering the results. Happily, neither of these is impossible. It is as natural for a person to register the quality of time as to breathe. It is an innate (and trainable) ability, as is indicated by the millions of ratings in various collaborative systems. The procedure does not require any special effort on the part of participants, nothing beyond what they are already accustomed to doing on the site when they post ratings. Let us not forget that by quality of time we have in mind a generalised emotional distillate of everything that fills time: experiences, reflections, insights, calculations, meditations, creativity. This characterisation is unnuanced and conveys only the vividness of an emotional colouration, positive or negative.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">How differentiated should the scale of measurement of quality time be? In theory it should, on the one hand, correspond to people’s ability to distinguish gradations of quality, and on the other provide an optimal balance between the intensiveness and precision of computer calculations. From the experience of recommendation sites, a five-point scale is not really sufficient. A ten-point scale is (and in the specialist literature one will find arguments in favour of a seven-point scale). If it is to become a tool for personal self-management, the rating of inner time should become a habit and occur almost unthinkingly. A good way of achieving this is by combining it with some routine activity, and here there is nothing better than the third-generation social networks where reflecting on the quality of time dovetails nicely with satisfying a whole range of other needs, such as navigation, self-presentation and socialising. It remains only to recognise this and start making ratings. Accordingly, to master the practice of managing subjective time it is necessary to: (1) make it a rule to rate the quality of personal time; (2) register the results in numerical form.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Although some of what is said here about subjective time is a matter for the future, managing it is not something unprecedented. Each of us is conscious to a greater or lesser degree of the potential value of our time, and to the best of our abilities we maximise the return from it. Everybody has a different planning horizon, with some people maximising their pleasures within the limits of the next half hour while for others it is decades. Some forms of activity are accepted as mutually complementing each other, with neither having to be given priority. Undemanding reading matter admirably complements the pleasures of the beach, while an intellectual who has worked hard need not be ashamed of preferring a low-brow movie to a profound and serious masterpiece, simply because at that particular moment he does not have the emotional resources to engage with the masterpiece. Having a rational attitude towards time does not mean squeezing the maximum out of every moment. That is just as prodigal as running full tilt in a long distance race. It is also fairly obvious that in the longer term the optimum will be to maintain a balance between activity creating the preconditions for future quality time and activity which gives an immediate return. Certain occupations are on the borderline, for example, gaining knowledge and, more broadly, consuming information. There is an obvious parallel with the way factories maintain a balance between preparation and actual production. When allocating time to various types of activity it will make sense to build up a balanced portfolio the way investors do. This should include “growth stocks” so that, when earlier activities begin to bore you, you have something to switch to. To conclude this list of helpful advice from the author on how to live your life, do retain a sense of moderation and do not get caught in a treadmill of time optimisation so that agonising about that does not mar the time it is supposed to improve. There are other fairly straightforward techniques for time management, but for most people they would not be acted on until a clear, systematic method has been devised.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The category of quality time allows us to understand a number of phenomena which are otherwise difficult to explain. Many people are puzzled when they observe notably carefree people totally devoting themselves to business. If we put to one side the suspicion that their supposedly Herculean overworking is a myth, their improbable busyness really does look to an outsider like Aristotle’s chrematistics, that is, making money for the sake of making money. In reality however, as we can now understand, for certain types of personality this is a way of maximising the quality of time. The position of the head of the firm, apart from its obvious material rewards, gives scope for freely managing time and personal resources. The leader himself determines the pace of work and play. He chooses when, with whom, and under what circumstances he will resolve particular issues; which of his pet schemes he will realise in practice; and what degree of dependence on the will of other players he is prepared to tolerate. If a person is possessed by a desire to organise his world so that within its confines everything should operate in accordance with the rules he establishes, no amount of prosperity will persuade him to stop.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">A capitalist who has become an addict of this kind of motivation is disinclined to allocate more than a modest percentage of his income to personal consumption. All the rest is ploughed back into his business and, in most cases, serves to benefit society. This is the moral justification of capitalism and altogether a strong argument in favour of it which seems never to have been clearly expressed. It seemed sufficient to claim that free capitalist competition between individuals pursuing egotistical aims works for the benefit of society as a whole. In fact, however, the benefit derives not so much from competition as from the fact that it goads the capitalist into reinvesting income in the business. De jure, the capital belongs to a private individual, but de facto that individual is stewarding it on behalf of the other members of society. Whether people are aware of the fact or not, entrepreneurs slog away not merely for their own benefit, but for the good of society.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The capitalist system concentrates capital and resources in the hands of those most capable of managing them. What the capitalist maximises is not money for his personal consumption (as far as that goes, the margin of utility is soon reached), but the opportunity to be his own master and the quality of personal time, a condition of which is the economic power he has acquired. Freedom for self-realisation and the scope for large-scale risk-taking are goods of which people never tire. As regards material freedom and physiological comfort, these, like any utilitarian goods which have become habitual, are perceived as no more than what is due. The least encroachment on them, however, will produce a sharply negative reaction and oblige the capitalist, regardless of his overworking, to rush to the defence of the status quo.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Managers one step down are already restricted in respect of this kind of freedom and beholden not only to circumstances but also to the management above them. They give up part of their freedom in return for guarantees and support from above. Those at the base of the pyramid of hired labour usually have very little freedom, but that does not deprive them of opportunities for self-realisation in their profession. It follows from this, inter alia, that Nietzsche’s notorious Will to Power, which has generated so much philosophical discussion and raised such a hullabaloo in Russian society, is merely a particular instance of a strategy aimed at acquiring quality time. This demystifies this human characteristic. In no way is it an inborn trait of human nature, as a familiar doctrine insists. The will to power is explicable as an aspiration to personal freedom, to be able to occupy yourself as you please, when and with whom you please. Power over others is a means of enabling a person to regulate relations between himself and his inner time. It is not the will to power but the quality of time to which everything can be traced back. These are the terms in which it should ultimately be interpreted. The primal principle on which any society is organised is the erection of a vertical hierarchy, and this too is associated with people’s aspiration to control time. To some degree that is why they climb the social ladder in the first place, in order to be able to impose on those below them the calendar they personally desire.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Recognising that inner time can be both positive and negative enables us to clarify a number of issues, the better to understand the processes of the New Economy. Choice, as we have seen, comes at a price. When that was realised, an amendment was made to the idea of classical economics that man was an ideal maximiser. It was seen that, when choosing, a person will eventually finds it makes better sense to stop at a satisfactory option rather than go on seeking the absolute best, as there is no guarantee that the additional search costs will be recouped. As Simon put it, the search continues until the additional marginal costs outweigh the anticipated gain from the search. This notion can be further refined by adding that we need to take account not only of time and psychological costs, but also of the value of the time spent in choosing.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">That process may itself give pleasure, and then the costs should be reduced by that amount and the search continued for longer than would be appropriate if it were not the case. On the other hand, the search may be exhausting and disagreeable, and then it would make sense to reduce the search time. The desire to avoid negative time spent on searching and anticipation means we need to be less picky. It is on this attitude that markets in which information is not transparent, including the cultural markets, often prey. The consumer agrees to practically the first thing he is offered, just in order to terminate disagreeable search time as quickly as possible. The burden of negative time spent choosing pulls down the average level of the quality of time lived.</Para>

            <Heading>Research into Emotional Dynamics</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Subjective time is associated with the emotions, and these have been little better studied than time itself. It would be good to have a clear picture at our disposal of the development of emotions, but for the time being we have to make do with very general, mostly artistic, representations. If the absence of knowledge about subjective time can be explained by its being overshadowed by time in general, emotions, on the contrary, are in full view. The preparatory work has already been done by psychologists. Theories have been proposed, emotions classified. It would be good now to embark on detailed study of their dynamics, to see how one succeeds another, how they unite and form stable combinations. Research in this area would have a clear practical application. When we are talking about happiness, itself regarded as an emotion, the role of emotions in a person’s inner life is clearly very important. In the near future we can expect to see the emergence of markets and of technologies associated with the management of emotions. So far, though, as in the study of other dynamic processes, the social sciences have had little success.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Even without research we can state with confidence that every emotion has a beginning, an end and a characteristic duration (which will be different for different emotions). We know, for example, that the acute phase of grief following bereavement lasts around 6 months (Vitis Vilyunas). As regards other emotions, we have only a modicum of knowledge about how they develop, and in particular about their duration. We may surmise that for each personality type a particular order and range of emotions is desirable, and that departures from this ideal will have consequences. A person needs to undergo certain experiences at particular times, but circumstances sometimes prevent this and cause a strong, often unrecognised and unsatisfied demand for situations which would enable harmonious emotional states to develop. If there is a shortage of certain experiences, a person’s emotional life may be disfigured, deviate from what is optimal, and be in need of correction. The individual tries his best to overcome the deficiency by seeking or even unconsciously setting up situations to provide an outlet for his emotions. Long suppressed irritation, for example, may burst out entirely inappropriately over some trifling matter.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">At this point it is worth turning our attention to one of the most pleasing but neglected attributes of art and the entire realm of the aesthetic. Art is a universal means of regularising the emotions. Aesthetic culture is a factory which manufactures experiences. Its storerooms are bursting with emotions preserved in texts, images and sounds (as well, of course, as with plenty of stuff which is past its sell-by date or was never much good in the first place.) Delving into these storerooms, a person can live a kind of other life which suffuses and expands his own. At the same time he enhances his emotional repertoire and learns to empathise: he sorts out his own “emotiogram”. These storerooms have the very valuable characteristic of being freely accessible, enabling a person to take advantage of them at a time to suit himself. From this point of view the very existence of culture assumes special significance.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">As with subjective time, collaborative practice also has a role in the studying of emotions. This would require a facility for registering emotions when rating works or other objects. On a software level this is not difficult. Some people will rush to see it as a further step towards mechanisation of the soul, the pharmacy issuing emotions on prescription (or without). I see no genuine threat here, especially since the idea is unlikely ever to be fully implemented. This upgrade to the cultural supermarket might even be welcome. What is wrong with delivering works in the light of demand for particular emotions? A similar service has been provided for years by music sites which will select music for a particular mood, and so far there have been no fatalities.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Although in the present volume inner time and emotional dynamics are considered only as they relate to collaborative practice, research in these areas obviously cannot be so restricted. Other approaches will need to be brought in, among them computer-assisted linguistics (semantic analysis of the blogosphere), computer-assisted tomography, neurobiology, research into sleep and dreams. A special place in this research should be reserved for music, which is based on perception of durations and is, of all the arts, the one most closely associated with subjective time.</Para>

          <Heading>The Measure of Symbolic Exchange: Second Money</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Having introduced the concept of subjective time we can now move on to the already mentioned matter of a measure for the symbolic. Until now this fundamental problem has unavoidably been put to one side, but all other attempts to devise a system of measurement in the humanities tie in with it. What is this measure? How, for example, is the value of a blockbuster to be compared with that of an art movie? Such traditional indicators as star ratings and box-office takings are, as we have seen, pseudo-measures of symbolic value. They are more likely to mislead than to enlighten. Who cares if some smash hit watched by millions has pulled in ten times more time and money than a movie with an audience of 100,000? We simply do not know the cultural impact of either of them, emotional, social, educational, developmental or other. Quite possibly that matters more than the difference in the size of their audiences. But then again, perhaps it doesn’t. Within one system of coordinates art movies are more valuable, within another blockbusters are. No matter what may be said, no agreement will be possible before we start using the concept of the quality of inner time.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">A work of art’s impact is determined by the quantity of associated quality time, which theoretically depends on the number of moviegoers (recipients), their level of cultural capital, and the strength of the impression made on each of them. Alas, the two latter quantities are completely unknown. Even points ratings indicating the degree of satisfaction do not help much because they do not contain the information needed to enable us to correctly correlate, for example, 100,000 viewings at an average rating of “6” with 10,000 ratings at an average of “9”. Bearing in mind that the starting point for a positive reaction is “5” (the so-called semantic zero in the 10-point scale), and taking account of how far ratings deviate from it in either direction, it would seem possible to even out the difference in the numbers of ratings. Alas, this approach, despite its obvious arithmetical neatness, gets us nowhere. The problem is that we do not know what psychological distance separates a “9” from a “6”. The points on the scale denoting the force of the impression made are not equidistant. For example, the jump from “7” to “8” may correspond in subjective perception to an increase two times, even three times, greater than a rise from “6” to “7”. We do not know. We can only say that if we had data about the true state of affairs, we would obtain a steeply rising curve, but exactly how steep we cannot say. There is no certainty either that gradations of satisfaction are identical in different sectors of consumption. It is logical to suppose that they differ. In short, the points from a satisfaction curve are turned into a logarithmic scale, and we can say nothing more definite than that. It seems reasonable to ask whether people would prefer five “7” movies or one with a “10” rating, but for a number of reasons it is quite impossible to establish this, and even direct questioning is unlikely to shed any light. From the statistics accumulated by recommendation sites we can see that there are between two and nine “8”s for every “9”. Given that range of dispersal it is impossible to establish a norm. The only thing that is clear is that this correlation is associated in some way with the short supply of high-quality movies, and that cinemagoers are unable to find them when they want them. It also seems to indicate that people need something light and relaxing, something to pass the time, and that plays into the hands of “7”-rated movies.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Our example is taken from the cinema, but it would not be difficult to find any number of other illustrations of the limited reliability of points. For example, it would be absurd to compare the points awarded to a joke, a video blog, or a ringtone with ratings of major art forms. We are dealing here with categories of entirely different weight. Points are uninformative not only when comparing different kinds and genres of art. For example, some reasonably well edited entertainment movie will have little trouble earning itself an “8” in the context of similar products with no particular pretensions. That same “8” will be awarded to an outstanding movie which has won it in the heavyweight category of major art. Obviously, these are “8”s of differing magnitude, but the points system blurs the difference. Despite the fact that ratings do not reflect an absolute value, they are better than nothing. In many cases, where all that is needed is a straightforward hierarchy, the points system works reasonably well. It works, for example, for collaborative filtering or in the awarding of examination marks in the education system. It is incapable, however, of producing absolute measurements.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">If we can’t use ratings, box-office takings, or points, what can we use as a measure of symbolic value? The fact of the matter is that right now there is nothing suitable. However, the fact that we don’t currently have a measure does not mean that one could not be created. The measure of the symbolic could be gratuity payments, that is, ordinary money used in the extraordinary function of post factum voluntary payments. The more donations an item collects, the higher its value. As this method of expressing satisfaction through monetary supplements becomes the norm, so values will be given numerical expression and it will be possible to rank them in order of the amount of money they attract.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The logic behind this solution is that symbolic value (applied to works) or symbolic capital (applied to artists) become visible through their ability to engender quality time. The measure of this ability can be gratuity money, as that is what reveals the subjective attitude of recipients to value. The fact that post factum payment (which is crucial if measurement is to be possible) is relatively rare at present should not put us off. This is learned behaviour. There are many signs that donating money is becoming normal and likely to grow in the near future. In the first place, a kindred phenomenon is already showing a considerable head of steam, in that education, medicine and the protection of nature, for example, are largely financed privately by charitable donations, and indeed the purchase of branded goods at thrice the price is itself not far removed from covert voluntary donation. In the second place, we know that in the past culture existed largely on the basis of patronage. It seems entirely natural to re-introduce this model, at least in part, in the latest spiral of history, with the difference that major donations will be replaced or supplemented by popular micro-patronage on a massive scale. Supplementary payments have an entirely utilitarian motivation, which also stimulates both producers and users. If we free ourselves of the prejudice against the “mercenariness” of money, it is easy to see how close a gratuity scheme is to the spirit of human relationships.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Now that we have a claimant to the role of a measure of value, let us support it by showing how the measurement might work in practice. At the same time, we will see that it is the only approach possible.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">It is generally accepted that the only way of measuring the value of goods is in relation to other goods. It cannot be inferred a priori and becomes visible only in exchange, with each side pursuing its own advantage and unwilling to give more for the good than it is judged to be worth. But what if products are not directly bartered for each other? If there is a good which participates in all exchanges, value can be expressed in units of that good, and in practice it is money which is the good universally exchanged. In the symbolic field, however, money is a bad instrument of measurement because it does not have stable purchasing power. An incontrovertible sign of money’s failure in this realm is uniform prices for entirely different digital products. Books, movies and sound recordings all cost the same, irrespective of their content or quality. For the symbolic we need some analogue of money, but one which corresponds to its needs and specifics. We need first to establish what the features of this second money should be, and then we will see how to arrive at it. Let us first think about the standard market measures of cost. What are the qualities of exchanged objects and what are the procedures which make quantitative evaluation possible? Knowledge of the inner workings of this mechanism will help us to discover second money.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">In the first place, to measure value we can use only something which is itself a limited resource. At least, it should be in short supply with the parties to the exchange, since otherwise the claimant to the role of the means of measurement would be exchanged for a needed good in arbitrary amounts, and would reveal neither the true need for the product nor serve as a measure of its value. A person has no shortage of rating points (except in rare situations where they are artificially limited), and accordingly points cannot serve as an instrument of measurement. In the second place, although value does exist in human minds, it is no easy matter to extract it from there. Even the individual himself will have difficulty estimating in purely intellectual terms how precious a particular object is to him, and to give a number to that value. He needs guidelines for comparison. In just the same way, it is difficult to gain a sense of the intensity of human sensations, experiences and motivations until they become manifest in decisions and actions. Value becomes objectivised in exchange and in no other way. Its primary indicator is the human individual, a kind of testing probe. Guided by his feelings, a person decides what quantity of a good in short supply (money) he is prepared to part with in exchange for a particular value. This decision cannot be taken in isolation, independently of other deals, and without their all taking their place within the context of the budget at the individual’s disposal. People can feel their way towards the monetary equivalent of value only through the regular practice of allocating their budget to categories of essential expenditure. Hence the third, least recognised but no less important, condition of the functioning of the traditional monetary system is the uniformity or repetitiveness of deals. In order to allocate the budget knowledgeably, the individual needs to have an idea of the value of particular goods, and for this he needs first to have experienced them. In addition, it is desirable to be able to estimate how well the selection of goods complement each other. Underlying more or less firm prices is the repetitiveness of acts of consumption. Providing there is uniformity and openness of dealings, the market mechanism of supply and demand reduces numerous private, subjective assessments to single prices. That is, it produces intersubjectivity of assessment. Quite soon an average (“fair”) price emerges which serves as a guideline for the parties. In the absence of repetitiveness and openness, for example when a good is constantly changing or deals are done in secret, the market is incapable of measuring value. If it does, there will be a wide margin of error.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Let us analyse symbolic exchange in the light of the three preconditions for monetary measurement listed above. Their presence will indicate where we can simply follow the logic of ordinary money, but their absence will oblige us to consider modifications.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">At least we do have one essential element, and that is a subject capable of judging value. Things are less easy in respect of everything else. As we have said, goods bearing value which is to be measurable by the market must be scarce, and the subjective need for them derives from past experience. The symbolic does not have this quality of scarcity. It is released into the air, it is on open access: on the internet, in libraries, in the ether and, with few exceptions, it is as free as air. (The exceptions include anything which has a material shell which is difficult to reproduce, for example theatre and graphic art.) This of itself virtually rules out monetary measurement. Unlike material goods and services, the consumption of symbolic products by one person does not deprive others of the same opportunity. Indeed, it is often case that the more extensive the circle of consumers, the better. The product may be present in unlimited quantities and is not removed from subsequent consumption, so where is its scarcity? One can artificially bar access and then demand payment to restore it, but given today’s facilities for copying and distributing content that is already almost impossible and likely to be even more problematical in the future (unless the content producers manage to lobby through wholly draconian measures against private individuals who infringe copyright). Symbolic products are not competitive and cannot be excluded from consumption. This is symptomatic of social goods which do not have to be paid for and which accordingly are at the mercy of freeloaders. Since symbolic exchange does not require strict observation of parity of benefit to the parties, the motive to track the proportions of the exchange disappears, with the result that no measurements are made. Conventional exchange reveals value precisely through the mechanism of firm recompense.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Let us abandon the dead end approach through scarcity of the symbolic product and try a different angle. Let us seek what could theoretically serve as an instrument of measurement in the symbolic realm. Clearly this should be universal and also in limited supply, since otherwise we will find ourselves trying to use a ruler with a movable scale. Perhaps time will serve? It seems a logical partner for the symbolic, no worse than money for the material. Time is plainly a limited resource and people have a fair idea of its value. Consumption of the symbolic involves the spending of time, and it should be possible to judge the value of particular products from the quota of time allocated to them. Alas, the idea of using time as an instrument of measurement does not survive closer scrutiny.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">If the anticipated utility of each cultural good was based on experience, then allocating part of the budget of time to it might possibly tell us about its value. The newer an information product is, however, the less predictable is its effect, and the more predictable it is, the less is its effect. The undoubted fact that the non-repetitive nature of symbolic goods hinders calibration of value using time is only half the problem. Time has another fundamental defect which puts an end to its candidacy. Of the two requirements a measure of value must meet, that it should: (a) be limited and (b) a valuable resource, time meets only the first. It is always limited, but by no means always valuable. The inner psychological value of periods of time of equal duration is highly variable. The real snag about measuring by the hour is that willingness to spend time very much depends on the value of what is laying claim to it. Lacking a stable value, time lacks the consistent purchasing power characteristic of money.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Worse is to come. Time nullifies its purchasing ability every second, urging a person to use it without delay and irrespective of the price. You cannot save it, cannot deposit it in the bank, cannot make it grow. It is spent irrespective of whether you intend to spend it or not. The impossibility of putting off the act until a more suitable moment devalues time and disqualifies it from being used to as a measure of values. If something analogous were to happen to money, that is, if it ever encountered a negative interest rate, everything in the world would change. If money burnt your hands, a person would throw it away on the first good that came along just in order to be rid of it. In such a situation there is no incentive to check parity or to weigh decisions. Information theory explains money by the need to use it to take a pause in exchange deals, giving one the opportunity to choose the optimal variant. Money mediates exchange, splitting the transfer of values from one set of hands to another into the two stages of buying and selling, and one can wait out the interval between them by using money. Time cannot function as an exchange intermediary because in the course of the exchange it will have been permanently reduced.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Accordingly, there is a void on both sides of the exchange equation. Measurement is the comparison of two scarcities, but there is none on either side of the scales. In one there is information, the value of which is to be measured but which is tending towards being a free good. On the other is the time which is spent on consumption of the information and, although in principle it is in short supply, that is not the attribute it is showing here. To correlate the one with the other is like to trying to balance two vacuums.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Labyrinthine as the maze may be, there is a way out of it, which we will find if we view symbolic exchange as a means of transforming an individual’s calendar time into quality subjective time. Speaking in purely economic terms, a person should allocate to the perception of various kinds of information such quotas of time (also of attention and other personal resources) as will yield a maximum of well filled and high-quality subjective time. This is not information in general, but the subjectively valuable part of information which engenders quality personal time, and that is the scarce resource we are seeking. Optimising time means (a) to use it in a timely manner; and (b) to fill it with valuable and valued content. This can be realised if content of the requisite quality is always to hand. Then, when a window of time appears, there will be options available with which to occupy it.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Although by and large there is no shortage of content, as soon as we start talking about the part which is of personal significance to a particular consumer, the shortage becomes as acutely perceptible as information about the quality of content is meagre. The access to value is obstructed by heaps of trash which has to be shovelled aside before one can reach anything deserving of attention. Since subjectively high-quality information has scarcity, its value should become apparent in the process of discovering it. This is precisely what occurs in a collaborative system: the second money it activates, and all the rest, serves as payment for high-quality information, including data on the quality of the information itself. In accordance with the collaborative principle one may not obtain a prediction without expending resources on creating one’s own profile, in the course of which the operation of subjectively weighing up value is performed which finds quantitative expression in post factum payment.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">When a large number of people reveal their view of value, that is itself a process of measuring it. It is essential, however, that this should be accompanied by the expenditure of resources which belong to them. The scarcity which is a condition for measurement of value is not where you would usually find it, not on the supply side with the necessary material resources, but on the side of consumption and, accordingly, of personal resources. This process of collaborative assessment of value is in some ways analogous to what occurs in conventional markets. By making purchases, a person satisfies his basic needs and only in passing, and in most cases without realising it, participates in the measurement of value, influencing the price. In our case, a person is striving to optimise his choice as a cultural consumer and also thanking the creative artist. To do so he performs a number of actions, a side effect of which is measurement. In return he receives indispensable navigation assistance. In this way, when measuring symbolic values the same conditions are observed as in the utilitarian sphere: the process is linked to many acts of exchange; it serves to optimise consumer choice; and additionally it is an incidental but inextricable part of exchange.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The idea of measurement by means of second money can be explained in another way, by making use of the concept of “consumer surplus”. This is how economists designate the difference between the sum paid in accordance with the price list and the amount a person would in principle be willing to pay if he knew in advance the utility he would obtain from his purchase. The sum of consumer surpluses, if it were published, would signal symbolic value. Although people are normally disinclined to reveal information which might be used to their disadvantage (for example, to raise prices), in the case of collaborative filtering the situation is the reverse: it is advantageous to communicate information, and this leads to personal gain.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The formula proposed in the last chapter, “time–text–time<Footnote ID="Fn1_3">
              <Para TextBreak="No">The measurement of subjective time by using second money affords an opportunity to calculate the results of symbolic exchange, and in particular its impact on culture. If germane methods appear in culture for measuring symbolic value, natural indicators and regulators or processes will arise which will allow symbolic markets to escape from their domination by commerce. Money for culture should not be generated artificially outside of culture and presented to it on a plate. It should emerge only from evaluation of subjective time through joint efforts. At first this will be done only through ratings, but gradually these will be replaced by voluntary post-factum payments, or second money.</Para>

          <Para TextBreak="No">However complex the system which conjoins collaborative filtering and second money, this is the solution to a problem which until now was considered insoluble. Moreover, everything relating to filtering has already been tried and tested. It is worth remembering that until quite recently this evoked no less scepticism than retrospective donation schemes of recompense do today. We believe that the business model of trust advertising will shortly help to overcome this scepticism, since it employs second money and is a hot topic. Without it no way can be seen of resolving the acute problem of monetising content production (as discussed in <ExternalRef>
              <RefSource>Chap. 2</RefSource>

          <Para TextBreak="No">And indeed, the method described for introducing it is not that difficult, bearing in mind the extraordinary nature of the task and the fact that everybody had lost hope that any solution existed. We are hardly going to measure talent in the proposed currency of “gauguins”. After extensive and fruitless searching it would be naive to expect a simple, one step solution. If there was one, it would have been found long ago. This did not occur because certain essential components of the solution were missing: post factum micro-payments and collaborative filtering. Today they have appeared, but to implement micro-patronage there is no escaping the need for major institutional changes.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The origins of second money deserve to be commented on separately. It has long been recognised on an intuitive level that culture needs its own regulator, in some ways analogous to money. Everybody involved in this realm has overtly or covertly suffered from the lack of a tool which would enable them to compare non-material values with each other and also with material values. Since ordinary money was obviously not up to the job, a need was felt for “cultural money”. Although the need was generally recognised, it was also obvious that any attempt to create it ex nihilo was doomed to fail. It was unclear, however, what the alternative was. Collaborative practice led to a situation where there was no need to invent it. It would be enough just to upgrade the use of existing money by introducing a retrospective scheme of payment for experience goods as the norm. Post factum gratuity payment would reflect the sum of consumer satisfaction. These extra payments can be implemented both within the collaborative system or outside it, as already practised on a mass scale by people giving financial or other support to initiatives they care about. Until these actions are included in a collaborative system, second money will not be able to perform its measurement function. Within the collaborative filtering option post factum payment is only partly voluntary because group stimuli and sanctions operate. Such nominally voluntary payments we call “second money”, and that is where the future of symbolic exchange lies.</Para>

            <Heading>Multifunctionality of Second Money</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Being able to measure the symbolic will cause a restructuring of all the markets and spheres of life involved. Until then, the symbolic realm will remain on the periphery of the empire of money, and money will assist in plundering the territory, like a colony, giving very little in return. Second money gives culture a chance to regain its sovereignty. As we have noted, one of the imminent metamorphoses is associated with trust advertising. There are other business innovations which promise major change in many markets: unmediated distribution with payment directly to the producer, and user certification of quality. The practical effect of the retrospective use of money will make itself felt only when it achieves the magnitude of an institution. Point-scale ratings in a recommender network are a step in this direction and through them the economic sense of post factum transactions will become clear, namely raising the efficiency of individual consumption. When the rating function is integrated with the function of post factum recompense to the creative artist, the points system will either be replaced naturally or supplemented by second money, bringing with it fully fledged monetary measurement.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Information economics theory tells us that money arose from the need to optimise exchange, to simplify the path of goods in hand to the person who needs them. Before money, this transition involved a succession of barter exchanges. A person organised a combination of preliminary exchanges in order to obtain goods which his opposite number, who possessed a good he required, would accept as payment. Money came into use primarily because it shortened this procedure, reducing it from many moves to two moves. Money reduced exchange to the two standard operations of buying and selling. The main idea behind money is that it makes possible the separation of an exchange in time and space. In order to do so it needs to be a transitional good with the power of universal exchange. Subsequently, two other functions were added to these initial functions of money as a means of circulation and measurement (which had enabled trade and commerce to get on their feet). It became also a means of payment and saving, as a result of which it became an inalienable part of the vast majority of transactions. The dazzling career of money is an example its offspring, second money, should imitate.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Second money will flourish on the same basis as brought money into use, the uncoupling of exchange. Whereas conventional money optimises material exchange, second money enhances symbolic exchange. As payment for information about the subjective quality of information, and making it possible instantly to choose the best options for expending time, it raises the liquidity of time. As already mentioned, an important factor is that this new measure does not arise in a vacuum but emerges from the already existent institution of money. A further advantage is that second money performs other functions, of which we can mention at least three: (1) payment for services of consumer navigation; (2) recompensing creators of products; (3) measurement of symbolic values. There is also the function of saving, or at least fixation of symbolic capital, discussed below. Second money is thus multifunctional, which was the very quality underpinning the vitality of conventional money.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The more diverse the applications of second money, the more straightforward its progress will be and the greater its chances of gaining acceptance. Accordingly, let us take a look at some other practical examples of the use of second money.</Para>

            <Heading>Monetising User Activity in Third-Generation Networks</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">When second money enters collaborative practice, the question will arise of whether to restrict the size of post-factum payments. If they are not regulated, and there seems to be no reason why they should be, people will be able to donate however much they consider appropriate, irrespective of normative frameworks which are difficult to define to everybody’s satisfaction. It will be found that, for a given level of satisfaction, well-to-do people are able to transfer more for a given product than those less well off. Accordingly, the effect of wealth will make itself felt. This will, on the one hand, complicate the game, but on the other it will offer some interesting possibilities. Despite people’s anxieties, amounts of different value will not particularly inhibit the work of the collaborative mechanism, since proximity of tastes does not imply absolute coincidence of user profiles. It is enough for them to be similar, and the computer algorithms are capable of detecting just that. However, in measuring the symbolic capital of goods and services the effect of wealth does need to be taken into consideration because it is proportionate to the sum of gratuity payments. Otherwise, we will find that if we take two works, one of which has been liked by people who are not well-off while the other has been equally liked by prosperous people, the former will lose out solely because its admirers have less money at their disposal for expressing appreciation. Does this mean that it has produced less effect on their souls and is less valuable? Probably not. If the differentiation of preferences does not correlate with the level of income or the same works are liked by rich and poor in equal measure, this distortion will not arise. However, it is not worth trying to calculate everything while “standing on the riverbank”. As soon as the system gets working, answers will be found to such questions. What we can say with all certainty at the present time is that monetary capital will be pumped over to symbolic capital and vice versa, and the result will be a better balance of each.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Post factum supplementary payments give solidity to a personal profile relative to a profile constructed solely on the basis of points. The actions of freeloaders underpaying for works they have liked could corrupt the system, but as a consequence the freeloader would incur costs in the form of poor quality recommendations and being ejected from the group. He faces the prospect of an inglorious demotion. Such is the basic defence of the collaborative system against parasites. Other defence mechanisms exist, based on the business motivation of users. As the experience of recommendation sites shows, a collaborative system can function effectively on points. At least, it can until it treads on the toes of affected industries by discrediting part of their output in the eyes of the public, which until then had been conscientiously paying up. At which point the industries will decide to smash the site. With the introduction into the system of money, recommender activity acquires its own business model whereby creators of information are rewarded in proportion to their contribution. A portion of post factum supplementary payments is directed to them, donated by users for the products they have recommended. We can and must see recommenders as conduits to a given good and, like any business facilitator, they have a right to an agent’s commission. Apart from commission payments, payment may be made to them directly out of gratitude, putting them on equal terms with the creators of products and services. This is logical, taking account of the fact that a good pointer is sometimes no less valuable than the object it points to. And if it makes sense to pay for high-quality information, why not pay also for information about the quality of information?</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Since behind every recommendation there are specific people (those taste neighbours of the user on whose judgements it is based), it is possible to distribute post-factum money to individuals without any kind of arbitrariness, on a purely market basis. A particular recommender’s share will depend in the first place on his contribution to the prediction (which we recall is dependent on the taste proximity of the recommender and recipient). In the second place, it will depend on the time when the rating is uploaded. Pioneering raters should be given encouragement. Additionally, the recompense can be increased in proportion to the size of the post factum payment a particular recommender made to reinforce his judgement (and that sum is unlimited). For example, if one of two recommenders has “staked” ten times more money on a work than a second, then, other things being equal, his shareholder’s stake in the prediction should be that amount greater, as should his part of the income received for the prediction. Post factum money is thus not a slice of forfeited income but a kind of stake in a futures derivative which returns income if there proves to be a demand for the user’s prediction. There is a kind of reciprocity: supplementary gratuity payments boomerang back to those who pay. This is a magical quality fundamental to the practice of sponsorship and donation which in no way detracts from their sincerity or attractiveness. At the present time it is difficult to calculate all the consequences of paying recommenders, but overall this scheme unambiguously strengthens the institution of collaborative filtering.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">This business model has nothing in common with past attempts to create a cultural stock market to accept predictions of future box office takings from movies in the process of being made. That was reminiscent of a racing totalisator and did not yield good results, principally because the gamblers were not creating any useful information. In our case what we are looking at is not guesswork but the exchange of actual experience, and that radically alters the situation.</Para>

            <Heading>Symbolic Capital and Symbolic Values</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In addition to symbolic values there is one further category which it is worth learning to measure, and that is the symbolic capital of various people. This is the ability of a person to produce symbolic value: works of art, maxims, texts, communications, anything which engenders quality time which can be measured in second money. Basing ourselves on the assumption that symbolic capital and second money correlate in the same way as ordinary capital and profit, we can put a value on symbolic capital. For this we can make use of existing practice: ordinary capital is assessed by its ability to generate profit, and symbolic capital should be quantified correspondingly in terms of revenue from second money.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Viewed in terms of the production of quality time, symbolic capital and symbolic values are kindred concepts. The difference is that the former is more a potential, while the latter is its realisation. A person possessing symbolic capital produces texts (in the broad sense of the word) and these, in proportion to their value, engender quality time. In actual fact the relationship here is more complex and less clear: works engender quality time and so does the creative artist himself, sometimes directly, without creating a work. His own behaviour is a kind of text. An evening in the company of a major personality is an example of how symbolic capital can translate directly into value. At the same time, a text can be a component of symbolic capital. It is not too much to say that not only a creative artist can possess symbolic capital, but so can the products of his creativity. In order to avoid confusion, however, we shall reserve the term “symbolic capital” for the person, and use the term “symbolic value” in respect of creations, whether these exist in verbal, written, or plastic form. Until capital is mobilised for the production of values, while it is awaiting its moment, it exists only in potential and it is impossible to form a judgement about it. In just the same way, symbolic values sometimes have to wait for their time to come and for them to be appreciated as they deserve. But even when capital is vested in some kind of form and presented to the public, it is still impossible to measure it with the kind of accuracy we are accustomed to in operations involving conventional capital, because it is difficult to predict the return from it. Texts are an objective manifestation of symbolic capital. To continue the parallel with conventional economics, this is a product created in use.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Symbolic capital encompasses the whole spectrum of human attributes affecting the ability to create high-quality communications. These include experience, knowledge, taste, social competence, motivation, charisma, talent, and many other human qualities. Making use of these assets and basing himself on already existing texts, a person creates new texts which possess greater or lesser value, and which circulate in broad or narrow circles. It is not possible to dissect symbolic capital, to weigh its various constituents, but it can be rated overall on the basis of values created with its involvement.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">All the symbolic values ever created add to the corpus of culture, increasing its total symbolic capital and preparing the way for the appearance of new values. Symbolic capital, like economic capital, is not self-sufficient: its generative, creative capacity is dependent on external factors, in particular such cultural institutions as (primarily) copyright, the material infrastructure, and the intellectual state of society. A potential movie maker of genius will have no career in a country without a cinema industry and (in all probability) probability theory would not have occurred to Pascal had he not had the game of dice to ponder.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">It is of great practical importance that the series “symbolic capital–symbolic product–symbolic effect” leads to a category which can be measured: quality time. If we start from this end, we can quantify the two preceding links. From payment for quality time we can deduce a magnitude for the values which generated the quality time, and from these values we can deduce symbolic capital. In economics the technique for doing this is known as the earnings multiples approach and it is used for valuing businesses. Suppose a business is valued at ten times the annual profit it makes (this multiple depends on the riskiness of the business segment concerned), then the capitalisation of a firm which makes a profit of 1 million a year can be assessed at 10 million.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">When speaking of symbolic value we are usually thinking of large, socially significant works, but the term should be understood more broadly: a great variety of manifestations of personality can engender quality time – oral performances or talks, public or private actions, – but irrespective of the kind of communication, a sign of value is a positive response from other people. Needless to say, the degree of influence exercised depends on the size and composition of the perceiving audience.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Symbolic capital is the engine of the New Economy. Just the fact of recognising that it is not only established creative artists who possess it but also ordinary people, is an important step. Ordinary people also emit information and, despite the difference in the power of the effect they produce, they can be included within a single system of symbolic coordinates and ranking. This reflects positively on the self-respect and motivation of members of communities. It is highly relevant to both professional and amateur creative artists, and indeed to people who are neither. In the past symbolic capital was considered the province of an elite but now we find that everybody possesses it. That does not mean that differences between people have been erased, but they are mitigated and from qualitative differences they become merely quantitative differences with many steps and gradations. This enables us to get away from a rigorous division into the first rate and lower levels, which in the past clipped the wings of many people.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">With the transfer of activity to web networks, the barriers and distances between people decrease in just the same way as for a business when it enters the stock market. The difference between the founding owners of the company and its shareholders in the general population is evened out, and the transition from one status to the other becomes a matter of quantity. Something analogous brings about the appearance of web media, which are more influential than the traditional mass media.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Although the value of the individual is a widespread postulate in present-day society, it remains largely declarative or only occasionally evident, rather than being something that people really have any sense of. If symbolic capital is measured and presented objectively, this may facilitate a transition from good intentions to actual practice. Given the prospect of social and group recognition, people may develop a taste for a symbolic career. Symbolic stratification is a real need in society, and felt all the more acutely as new groups organise themselves. Objective measurement may provide a crucial impulse. The conditions for this already exist, with communications and the attitudes towards them documented in third-generation social networks. There is every reason for one of the important subsystems for measuring symbolic capital, personal reputation, to emerge in these networks.</Para>

            <Heading>Symbolic Capital and the Reputation System</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Reputation is what other people think about the merits or demerits of a person, an institution, a business or a good. As regards people, reputation is part of their symbolic capital. It represents a projection of their symbolic capital into a particular sphere of activity and is significant within the framework of a particular community. Reputation performs the important function of predicting and guaranteeing quality. When accessing any information, people trust it to the extent that its source has given a good account of itself in the past. Reputation grows out of attitudes towards earlier activity. To put it simply, most people trust what has proved trustworthy in the past. They trust, knowing that the possessor of their trust will think very carefully before saying or doing anything which might harm his reputation. Brands operate on the same principle: investments in making themselves well-known serve as a pledge of the reliability of the business.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The object of our interest is reputations in formal communicative systems, primarily on the internet where communications are documented and can be categorised. Reputations formed in everyday life from miscellaneous information are not considered here because of the difficulty of detecting them. Obviously, reputational hierarchies depend heavily on which transactions between participants are taken into account, how far they reflect the real relationship, and how much is left out. Naturally, the more representative the registered transactions and the more precisely they are interpreted, the more reliable the reputation. The citation indices used on scholarly publications are a method for calculating reputation as simple as they are crude. They take account only of references to publications, but as no allowance is made for whose judgement this reflects, that of a professor or of a first-year student, or of how significant the context is in which the quotation figures, important information is lost. This has negative consequences for scholarship.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Internet search systems have made great advances in this area, since the order in which they deliver website addresses and pages in response to user enquiries is linked to the reputation of the sources, which is something they first establish. The Google PageRank algorithm computes the significance of a particular internet page using the logic that if a page contains a link to another, it is giving that page its vote. The more votes a page collects, the more important it is assumed to be. Account is taken of the weight of the page which is voting. Search systems have also solved the problem of mutual backscratching, against which academic citation indices have no defence. These principles have acquitted themselves well in practice and should be used when calculating personal reputation in groups.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In social networks reputation has a particular applied significance since it indicates the “quality” of the person you are communicating with. The demand for such grading must be extremely high, and one can only express amazement that the most visited international and Russian social network sites make virtually no use of this tool. There may be a conscious reluctance to reveal who is who, a fear of scaring off a proportion of users by indicating their place in the insider hierarchy.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">For obvious reasons, reputations are particularly important in recommender systems, and these have far more data on the basis of which to establish them. If all that is registered in conventional social networks is whether a user has said “thank you” and whether a posting has been awarded a plus or minus, on recommendation sites a whole range of transactions can be taken into account: a user expressed thanks, followed advice, gave a reference, positively or negatively rated a comment, text, or photograph, requested a recommendation, forwarded a posting, etc. A comprehensive system for calculating non-professional reputations is to be found on the Russian Imhonet website, where each of these standard actions carries a particular weighting, depending on how much it contributes to reputation. More than a dozen actions are identified and, just as in the search systems, mutual backscratching is identified and eliminated. Reputation calculated in this way also grades interest in the user and his reliability, so-called goodwill. This serves as a further line of defence for the social network from fakes, fictitious infiltrated users, whose task is to manipulate data in the interests of sundry groups.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In the generally accepted navigation systems which provide ratings, charts and the like, data about the source of information is lacking, and this seriously detracts from the information itself. One cannot tell whose opinion the ratings reflect, and in charts constructed on sales data it is not even clear whether the public finally gave a product a positive or negative assessment. In recommender systems everything is transparent: you can see who is awarding reputation, and how it is arrived at.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">A person’s reputation can be calculated not only in general but also in respect of particular areas of expertise in literature, cinema, wines, photography or whatever, but also in respect of groups within whose framework it matters. This is of fundamental importance, since reputation in general is one thing, while reputation in a particular area is quite another. One can compute the overall reputation of a group in the eyes of wider society (or of some segment of it). One can calculate reputation on the basis of particular areas of competence, since it is often the case that a person is strong in one respect, as a critic or populariser, but does not enjoy more general respect.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">A multi-factor calculation of reputation is a step forward from anything that has been done in this area so far. Second money will allow us to further raise the quality of the computations. It will enable a network’s participants to express their attitude to each other’s actions or comments quantitatively. PageRank, although it takes account of the density of transactions, does not know how much reputation is communicated in each. This is inevitable, since the search engine is dealing with inanimate objects, and websites cannot be asked directly how well one thinks of another. Accordingly, the order in which search engines deliver information sources in response to user enquiries does not reflect reputation in its precise meaning. A collaborative system, on the other hand, operates with unambiguously treated signals from people, which enables it to replicate precisely the logic by which off-line reputations are built. If to this we add the difficulty of mechanically interpreting the aims of enquiries, we can see how search results might be improved. For this, search and recommender technologies should be brought together to place a collaborative superstructure over the search system. That is, first a search should be conducted using the customary methods, and then the sources found should be filtered with the aid of a collaborative algorithm, promoting to a place among the first entries for a particular user what has previously satisfied enquiries from his reference group. This could create a next generation search engine capable not only of selecting information sources, but also of delivering them in accordance with the priorities of each individual.</Para>

            <Heading>Three Mechanisms for Social Innovation</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">We have discussed consumer testing, voluntary post-factum payment, new business models in the digital industries, and other innovations which in the near future will be widely implemented. These are topics which impinge directly on business interests and are accordingly being actively discussed in professional circles and the media. The latter are, of course, themselves at the epicentre of events and seriously concerned that the content they create migrates to the internet, there to be consumed free of charge. The digital sphere which created the problems is likely to be the first to find a solution to them.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The question is, how and when will this occur? The practices and norms of behaviour described above are subject to a network effect: the more people profess them, the greater their value for each individual and therefore the more assured is their growth. While there are still not enough people involved, the web (like a club) is not all that exciting a place to be. A telephone would be no use if you were the only person who had one, which meant there was nobody to call. The system of collaborative filtering does not generate high-quality recommendations if it only has a few users. This is the so-called “cold start” problem. One has to surmount a certain quantitative barrier before stable, self-willed growth will occur. The new group will accumulate the critical mass of supporters required for lift-off only when a sufficient number of people believe in its value, and this comes through its being used. There is a chicken and egg situation here. The difficulty of institution building (as of any innovation) is precisely the synchronicity of these processes. From time to time, however, the new does manage to break through. Of particular interest are changes which are not imposed from above but grow from the grassroots, free activity of people, and this is a characteristic of the New Economy. Such novelties are closely linked to the mood of the masses, which in turn is associated with the dissemination of information within a society. The mechanisms of dissemination have been one of the least studied aspects of social life, hence the groundbreaking nature of the research discussed above. At the same time we have stressed that the most convenient bridgehead for such experiments is social networks on the internet. We need only to decide what to focus on, which is what we will do now.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">There are many reasons why it is desirable to have an understanding of the mechanism of social start-ups, and to be aware of the conditions under which the institutions of the New Economy (collaborative filtering and micro-patronage) can take off is important for the present investigation also. This is what we need to concentrate our efforts on.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Much remains obscure about how institutions, standards and customs emerge, even when this occurs right under our noses, to say nothing of the distant past. Familiarising ourselves with existing descriptions of this process, we often have the impression that something fundamentally important, something decisive for the outcome, is being missed. Sometimes social consciousness registers the fact of the birth of institutions only after a long delay. Even when they are up and running, it is by no means the case that they are immediately understood. For example, the importance of even such an exceptional invention as the department store was not fully understood or appreciated at the time. There was, after all, more to the idea than merely offering a variety of goods in a compact area, which had already been done in ancient markets. The department store (one of the first opened in Milan in the second half of the eighteenth century) caused an information revolution by reducing transaction costs of haggling for the best price. Before this, the shopkeeper himself haggled with the customer, which meant he was constantly busy. In a department store prices are fixed and openly displayed, so there is no need to haggle. This makes it possible to put a less qualified person behind the counter while the entrepreneur gets on with expanding his business. A similar benefit, from the viewpoint of the customer, was that previously sorting matters out with the shopkeeper was the duty of the lady of the house, whereas now the servants could be dispatched to shop in the department store.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Or another example, image advertising. For a long time economists were perplexed by whether this was a form of coercion of customers. It was decided that it was a fundamental institution with roots in the most ancient practices of sacrifice. By paying for this, the advertiser was giving a pledge which signalled the quality of his goods. (A substantial contribution to the theory of this kind of signal was made by Michael Spence, one of the pioneers of information economics theory.)</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The promotion of institutional innovations, and of particular techniques to enable them to enjoy a viral distribution, comes almost entirely under the heading of search and serendipity rather than of routine technology. There was a particularly dense fog surrounding the early stages of the process, and this drew our attention to the theory of superstars, snowball theory, and cheap talk theory, which were elaborated in connection with such situations. They were all formulated at different times, but for us what matters is to link them together and apply them to a wide range of phenomena. Although by and large only the theory of superstars can be considered a real theory (and that only at a pinch), while the other two concepts are one step down, the significance of this trio for understanding social evolution can hardly be overstated. I am certain they deserve to be far more widely known and receive a great deal more attention than they do at present.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The central question addressed by the theory of superstars is, why, out of numerous representatives of the creative professions, are particular individuals found at the top who are being paid astronomical sums? This is much the same question as we are interested in: why do certain innovations take off, while others do not? One of the explanations, propounded at various times by Adam Smith, Alfred Marshall, and Sherwin Rosen, comes down to the fact that several run-of-the-mill singers cannot replace a single Chaliapine. Because of immense demand, an outstanding talent becomes a superstar. This thesis is not entirely convincing. If at a given moment there is a shortage of Chaliapines, the stars do not disappear. Sheer force of talent, at first sight the obvious and self-evident explanation, will not do. It might close off the argument if somebody was head and shoulders above the rest and a star of the first magnitude, but such instances are rare. Far more typical is a situation where a pool of competitors is in no wise inferior to the leaders and would seem perfectly well able to attain those heights, only it doesn’t happen. A huge disparity in salaries may (and does) occur even when there is no particularly marked difference in talent. Moshe Adler associated the limited number of stars with the limited space on the Mount Olympus of social attention. Consumers do not need an infinite proliferation of celebrities, because then it would be difficult to find someone else to discuss them with. If everybody chose their own star, conversation would dry up.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">This explanation is wholly in the spirit of the group economy: empathising with popular performers, being up-to-date on hot topics, works, events, enables people to minimise the costs of making and maintaining contacts. The motive behind such synchronisation of preferences is rational use of such resources as attention, memory and time.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">People have a great urge to socialise, and what provides the excuse is not all that important. A superstar is created, not so much because of the performer’s inherent qualities, as by the need to satisfy a demand, that is, an extraneous factor from the sphere of information economics. Similar considerations apply to omens and superstitions, whose specific semantic content is fairly arbitrary but whose purpose is to reduce the number of options of behaviour, and thereby the costs of choosing. This probably all sounds a bit odd, but everything falls into place if we treat human attention as a resource for which the competition is no less fierce than for customers with disposable income. The fact that the explanations proposed by the theory of superstars do not seem obvious only shows how novel the logic of the New Economics still is.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">If superstars are recruited from a pool of people of approximately equal talent, how come one of them rises to the first magnitude? The answer is to be found in the metaphor of the snowball, which explains the ultimate breakthrough into popularity as being due to an advantage at the start. The handful of snow which starts rolling first gets more snow stuck to it faster and more easily, and leaves less behind for its laggard competitors. As applied to top internet sites, this means a critical mass of users has been acquired who have mastered the useful functions, become familiar with the layout, provided themselves with contacts (“friends”), and communicated something about themselves. In a word, they have built a home in cyberspace. For a competing resource to lure these people away needs a Herculean effort, which can be theoretically quantified as the time and money the user will need to spend in order to adapt to a new site. Let us suppose that it is going to take 2 h to become familiar with the new place and sort everything out. If we treat this as low-paid work and assess it at a rate of $5 an hour, then to attract a single user will cost a minimum of $10. In practice the sum will be higher, because something needs to be added by way of compensation for emotional attachment to the earlier habitat which the user is being asked to sacrifice. The cost of attracting that first, most difficult, million users adds up to a very appreciable sum. In addition, those creating the network do not know exactly when or how they will be able to convert the heads they have hunted into revenue.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">It is still unclear, however, why one particular handful of snow should be the first to start rolling. The theory of superstars has no answer, although from a practical point of view this is a crucial issue. In order to find the answer, let us turn to the concept of “cheap talk” from game theory, where the term is applied to communication at the start of a match which determines its course. A textbook example is bluff in a game of poker. Economists have already used the term “cheap talk” to explain the success of advertising campaigns in which magical qualities are ascribed to goods and a unique aura to brands (Birger Wernerfelt). For example, a certain company claims that people who buy its products will find the solution to some kind of insoluble problem in their life. For certain users, gullible or who merely enjoy trying out anything new (and 2 or 3% of society consists of such people), this is enough to make them choose the product, despite the fact that the producer’s assurances may be entirely groundless. Hence the epithet “cheap”, because unproven. If a sufficient number of such people is acquired, the snowball is on its way. Thereafter it grows without outside help in accordance with the scenario described above. A claim, thrown out into society virtually at random, gains weight and may become a self-fulfilling prophecy. This is how certain goods focus demand on themselves. On the whole, it is to the advantage of customers because the price will go down. The same applies to ideas and rules of behaviour. If everywhere one constantly hears that gentlemen prefer blondes, they really will.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">If a horoscope prescribes that a capricorn is steadfast and an aquarius contrary, that is often how they will be perceived. A necessary condition for bringing people with similar preferences together is to identify a cause and a rallying point for the first adherents. It is relatively easier for others to join the pioneers, and the numbers swell in accordance with snowball logic. People prefer the most successfully launched goods and brands, despite the fact that others available at the time may be no worse. Thus does “cheap talk” act as an impeller to get things going, and thereafter the course of events can be directed along a desired scenario. The same result is achieved by extravagant advertising, a path chosen by producers confident of the quality of their goods, and also by those who find it most convenient to make a pledge through image advertisement to persuade people of the quality of their goods. Out of context and without an understanding of the role ascribed to it, “cheap talk” looks arbitrary and fairly senseless, but in fact it does make sense, and considerable sense at that. It focuses people’s attention on a relatively small number of alternatives and minimises the delays and costs of choosing.</Para>

            <Heading>The Art of “Talk” in Contemporary Art</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The range of phenomena where the logic of cheap talk operates is extensive and includes, for example, political and stock market processes, scientific doctrines, a variety of subcultures and much else. These, if not viewed from the perspective of the trio of theories we are considering, can seem to be merely the play of chance or a scenario rigorously programmed by circumstances. Certain sectors, for example, sport, where in most cases quality is objectively registered, are relatively immune to the influence of injections of information. Even in sport, however, winners are sometimes “appointed”, and even in engineering technology, which would appear to be wholly resistant to manipulation, “cheap talk” plays no small part. It finds scope, for example, where there needs to be a decision on the financing of a particular technological policy and where the merits of the alternatives are not, at that moment, entirely obvious.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">As regards contemporary art, “cheap talk” has acquired such power that it often stands in for the works themselves. Artists organise surprising actions, for example, wrapping buildings or bridges in cellophane, or exhibiting doggie doo and seek thereby to shift the boundaries of perception of the public. Pictures, installations and performances may be full of profound meaning (like, no doubt, the above-mentioned works which all caused a great stir at the time), or they may have a less impressive content or even have no meaning at all, amounting to the purest placebo. Their mission is to assemble a group of people, and it doesn’t much matter if the king is found to be wearing no clothes. Taken outside the logic of group or club communications, the happening may have no significance whatsoever.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The apotheosis of this tendency has been the flash mob event, during which people get by admirably without an artist. All they need is a coordinating signaller. Indeed, if at one time artists rejected form, then content, why are they now needed at all? Matters have developed to a point where their services are rejected. Why should the public not ask, “What’s so special about him? We’ve got polythene too”.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In the spectrum of emotions evoked by contemporary art, awe is far from enjoying first place. This has facilitated the appearance of a new trend in culture. While the artist was surrounded by an aura of unattainability, seen as God’s elect, expected to produce a shock effect on viewers, few ventured to try their strength as creators and appear in public. As soon as this restriction was lifted, a great flood of amateur creativity washed over culture. In part this brought about the burgeoning of the blogosphere, where users do their darnedest to create their own flash mobs and to glory in their moment of fame. This also explains the exaggerated popularity of broadcasts in which dilettantes squawking like chickens sing some mediocre ditty and the audience joins in. A revival of amateur artistic activity is occurring on an amazing scale, and although at first the downside of the process is more in evidence, in future this will benefit culture, including its more exalted realms. Just as football in the courtyard feeds into the national team, so karaoke produces at least excellent listeners.

They are increasing their output and producing weaker and weaker products. A host of competitors of a new kind is taking a slice of the attention market away from them and the quality gap between what they and their rivals produce is narrowing. With the appearance of Web 3.0 tools, users are taking over the function of experts and discovering talent themselves, putting publishers under pressure. Similar threats hang over writers, at least those of average or little talent. They are being successfully replaced by bloggers. If by and large the democratisation of culture can only be welcomed, one hopes that artists will not surrender to cheap talk to the extent that they are reduced to the status of a beacon for someone else.</Para>

            <Heading>“Cheap Talk” as a Signal to Diverge?</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In the theory of superstars the sequence of cause and effect is reversed: the actual qualities of an object mean little by comparison with the dynamics of its popularity. This provocative thesis not only throws light on the origins of superstars but also enables us to look differently at a whole swathe of social phenomena where we are puzzled that the situation has resolved itself in one way rather than another. Where there is a sheaf of possible scenarios, there is always a cheap talk competition to decide the winner. This process is not as random as many people believe.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The spring which drives the mechanism is that human need for high-quality, congenial contacts which is satisfied by joining a suitable community. Superstars, brands, religious trends, political parties, fan clubs (and also such issues as whether to eat your boiled egg from the big end or the little end, or how to perform religious rituals): it is all a matter of finding ways to split up into groups, thus optimising one’s social habitat. No small contribution to this is made by art, which thereby demonstrates its social credentials. Artists are emitters of artistic statements and the public serve as a filter which allows works through or blocks them depending on how far they meet their need for social consolidation or fragmentation. On the whole it does not really seem to matter so much what the issue is, so long as it is presented starkly. This will prove the occasion for people who are in some respect outsiders to differentiate themselves from others, to diverge, and for those with some degree of kinship to coalesce. In retrospect researchers imbue clashes which played a notable role in history with portentous meaning, but the truest and deepest meaning is simply that a question is openly raised which provokes people into thinking, deciding their position, and adhering to one side or the other.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Facing people with a dilemma is an ancient and infallible method of dividing society into camps based on the documented attitude of people to a doctrine, a topic, facts, or a ritual. This same universal technique is at the basis of today’s mutual filtering, which people use on each other and in which all manner of means of attracting one’s own sort of person are brought to bear: dress, manners, actions, provenance, links with mates from school and college, and general acquaintances. In the computerised version, selection is conducted also along lines of tastes, preferences and interests. The organic way in which collaborative filtering is spreading on the internet derives from the fact that precisely these procedures (only more spontaneously and less consciously) have always been used. Present-day technologies have merely automated and perfected them.</Para>

            <Para TextBreak="No">If everything relating to the formation of superstars was really so much a matter of technique and the knack was merely to get known first, why would not everybody try their luck? Alas, the trick is not so much getting off to a quick start as managing to pluck the right heartstrings, since otherwise the snow (the resource of attention) will not stick. The trio of laws described above gives no guidance as to what happens at the very earliest, embryonic, prenatal stage of preference formation, and yet this is precisely what will decide which offering of cheap talk will be taken up. Without this link the whole chain of deductions is like a rope ladder which does not quite reach to the ground. This link, I suggest, is related to imprinting, which was popularised by Konrad Lorenz.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The essence of this phenomenon is conveyed by a photograph which has found its way into the textbooks: it shows Lorenz walking along, followed by a group of goslings. It transpires that, shortly after hatching, goslings seek the image of their mother. They identify her solely because she is the first thing that moves in their field of vision, and follow her. It is important who or what that first thing is. In the experiment it was Lorenz, and the goslings were drawn after him as if after their biological mother. His place could equally well have been taken by a moving balloon. They would have accepted that and, having made their choice, would have completely ignored their real mother if they met her.</Para>

              <Heading>Imprinting in Man</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Imprinting has been most fully studied in animals. It has been established that before they appear in the world their first steps are programmed in the form of a collection of reactions to the conditions they are going to meet. These investigations, together with much valuable information about instincts and the organisation of the brain, have enabled us to unlock the secret of how canaries sing, and to explain how a salmon travels all the way back to its long abandoned birthplace to lay its eggs. The topographical sense of bees and wasps is also a result of imprinting. As regards human beings, they have been studied less since one has to be considerably more circumspect in handling them. A researcher is hardly going to shove some inanimate object in front of an infant in a bid to replace its mother. Although it would seem that for a whole variety of institutions which fish for human beings (politicians, traders, clergymen) there could be nothing more tempting than learning how to programme personality and mould character.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">For all the sparsity of the data about imprinting in man, the mechanism is so important for the New Economy that it is worth trying to generalise everything which in one way or another relates to it.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">We know that people are more vulnerable to imprinting in certain states of mind, which leads to an ineradicable acceptance of something. During these particular periods in their life, certain images, positive or negative, can become fixated. These then assume an unchallengeable significance for the person and this persists for many years, predetermining principles, inclinations, methods of perception and so on. Periods of particular impressionability are found mainly in infancy, and to a lesser extent in early adulthood. Something similar to imprinting does, however, also occur later, although in a less pronounced form. In infants subsequent social conditioning has yet to blur the picture, so they have been studied more and with greater success. In adults imprinting tends to be confusingly overlaid by other effects (which does not mean that it is not there). Something which supports the view that late imprinting exists is the fact that certain mental techniques make reimprinting possible (Timothy Leary), that is, reprogramming the alignment of an individual’s personality. The practice of conditioning a person away from alcoholism is probably a phenomenon of this category. Imprinting in man is not a lifelong trap, but immense efforts are needed to escape from it. Occasionally this does happen spontaneously over time. It has been established in recent years that it is possible to deliberately edit memory with the assistance drugs. Unlike the inducing and development of conditioned reflexes, as studied in Pavlov’s dogs, with imprinting the fixation is stamped on the personality on a single occasion, without repeated stimulation. The necessary condition for imprinting is an emotion which sears the depths of the soul, which is probably applicable to any persistent effect in the mind. The durability of an impression is always related to the strength of emotions, and these in turn depend on the mind’s willingness to respond to the stimulus, and on its magnitude.</Para>

              <Heading>Narrative Knowledge About Imprinting</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Psychology has neglected the topic of imprinting in man. Perhaps in the past there was a lack of suitable tools for such complex research, so that it was impossible to produce experiments which could be replicated. Today the issue just seems to be overlooked. The present-day economy is an interweaving of motivations and desires and, engaging with it, we simply cannot ignore what lies at the root of the forces which motivate a human being. Observations suggest that imprinting is fundamental to much of human behaviour, if less incontrovertibly than in our fellow animals.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">The fact that psychology is ill-informed about imprinting does not mean that we do not meet its manifestations in everyday life. How many stories have we heard about how a child has developed an obsession. Some uncle eight times removed has appeared briefly in the family wearing his captain’s cap and before you know it a boy is halfway to naval college. Something of the kind is behind the history of Peter the Great’s toy flotilla, said to be behind his later love of the navy. Perhaps a boy has seen how girls his own age dress their dolls and much later discovers a predilection for that particular kind of appearance. The role of imprinting in matters of the heart is not entirely clear, but is certainly significant. At the very least it can be traced in the perception of types of beauty, which are laid down by toy factories and polished by advertisements and glossy magazines. And of course there is that fatal sensitivity, made the more powerful by long abstinence, which creates a fertile soil for love at first sight. Imprinting influences also the particulars of sexual behaviour. It seems that a majority of transvestites were dressed in clothing of the opposite sex in childhood. Another example, from the Middle Ages, tells how the sight of a naked body beaten with rods was a source of erotic stimulus for many. In the modern age, with the abolition of such public punishments, sexual perversion of this kind has become rarer. Relations between parents and children, etched in the subcortex, cause children when they grow up and themselves become parents, to replicate past experiences, negative as well as positive. Having suffered in the past, people are unable to free themselves from the programming.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Imprinting manifests itself in phobias and fears, in the mastering of languages and in many other ways. Various viral effects are evidently associated with it (including those on the internet), when some craze becomes instantly popular. Successful advertisement too cannot do without it. Delving back in memory, a person may sometimes resurrect some pivotal moment when a decision was suddenly ready to be adopted, or a new way of perceiving, or an attitude to the world (aesthetic, pragmatic, moral, religious, scientific), which became dominant. At some point in the distant past a switch became fixed at a certain position and the child grew up to be an activist or a conformist, preferred numbers or letters, inclined to a particular way of filtering information, or formulated questions to the world which would guide him for the rest of his life.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">How educators would like to catch this moment and direct the child’s powers in his best interests as seen by his parents! If only they could etch into his subconscious a “correct” attitude so that thereafter everything would go swimmingly and the person would absorb only what was wholesome. No such precedents are known. Influencing consciousness is the province only of specialists in the behavioural rehabilitation of alcoholics, and brand managers. When something is brought close to an infant’s eyes or he has his attention focused on some detail, he is being given the keys for further, subsequent perception. Science does not, however, tell us how to manage imprinting. Nobody presumes to predict what will take with a particular person, or when.</Para>

              <Heading>Imprinting and Attention Economics</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Much remains obscure about a person’s imprinting, but one thing is not in doubt: it is linked to the mechanisms of decision making and hence plays a role in the economy of desires. It is of fundamental importance that, even before a person finds himself faced with a choice, he is largely preprogrammed, not only by ordinary, rational considerations but also by certain crucial episodes in his past or, more precisely, the imprints they have left in his mind. An economic logic can be found in imprinting itself. In essence it operates like an information filter, letting one thing through but blocking another. The whole system of personal attitudes may be regarded as a complex hierarchical filter. Along with early, basic imprints it includes later images, acquired reflexes, fixed fantasies, motivations – all of which determine attachments, habits, perception, character traits, and indeed the whole way of life. Each new imprint attracts or rejects, conditioning selectivity in the reception of information. There is thus a direct link between imprinting and attention economics. The mechanism simultaneously delimits permissible decisions and serves as a regulator of the intake of information. Without it the human brain would grind to a halt, unable to cope with the torrent of signals.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">If we approach this field with strict criteria, only a fairly narrow circle of phenomena will be found to relate to imprinting as such, but a whole series of kindred mechanisms operate similarly, leaving impressions in the human mind. These traces may differ in depth and clarity and may result from repeated, deliberate conditioning rather than occurring as instantly and spontaneously as imprinting. There may be substantial differences between them and in how they affect consumer behaviour, but for the time being the mechanisms of impression have been insufficiently researched and we cannot fill in the detail. The main point is that, quite independently of marketing techniques for leaving impressions, the human mind is peppered with them. The moment decisions have to be taken, past impressions operate like railway points, directing actions along one track or another. The mechanisms of acceptance or non-acceptance also vary, depending on an unconscious willingness to allow something into oneself (imprinting) or a conscious opposition to, for example, advertising. We can draw an analogy with the procedure of weighing something, picturing the imprint as a heavy weight placed on the scales and all the other motivations in the form of makeweights added to one side or the other and overall adding up to a considerable weight in their own right.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">As the personality develops, the system of filters which help the mind to process reality becomes more complex. New impressions are either overlaid on existing ones or are rejected by them. Before they are allowed to settle into the existent motivational framework, certain conditions have to be met and they have to cohere with previously acquired imprints. Dependent on that, certain impressions (motivations, desires, habits) find the road ahead open, while others find it closed. Imprints thus work directly on their own account, but also indirectly by programming subsequent inclinations. These fundamental and derivative impressions are consolidated in the mind as habits and a way of life and are interlinked by a thousand different threads. You cannot just tear one out of the fabric. A person who is overweight will find it difficult to decide simply to give up eating an evening meal. If an innovation conflicts with the system of impressions already established, the latter will try to nullify it.</Para>

              <Heading>From Imprinting a Person to Imprinting a Society</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Imprinting can be found also in a society. It influences the direction taken when there is a fork in the road of history. When they try to interpret such moments, people often talk about providence or chance, but imprinting suggests a different explanation. At the social level this mechanism manifests itself in the totality of imprints most frequently encountered in people, in basic values and ethnic stereotypes which regulate many different spheres: the attitude to love, discipline, faith, puritanism or hedonism, usury, a leadership-or-community orientation. This amalgam is given the somewhat outmoded title of national character. Common morality arises from the synchronised imprints received from a shared environment with stimuli which are similar for everybody. Cliches are drawn from language, folklore, texts and everyday life, from “culture” in its broadest sense. Life sets traps for the mind, but also helps it to become receptive (imprint vulnerability), creating a tension if something is lacked and as a result evoking a dramatic emotional reaction when a desired stimulus occurs. In different geographical regions the mind of a child is “stamped” in different ways. The national way of life has its unique primary socialisation of children. Local norms of swaddling, hygiene, safety, obedience and independence, cuisine informed by maternal warmth, the culture of emotional upbringing within the family, these are the rocks to which personality is anchored. Since the norms of everyday life are the same for everyone and permeate all layers of society, this cumulation of deeply buried stereotypes awaiting their hour is also largely homogeneous.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Imprints are synchronised within one generation but are transformed by the next. Conditions change, and by no means all the images which so captivated parents can be handed on in the relay race. Descendants are not receptive to all of them. The imprinted images of generations differ all the more strongly if the realities of childhood years have been greatly different. The experience which parents have accumulated may prove invalid under new conditions. The changes which have taken place in the digital age have engendered a so-called prefigurative culture, a situation where less that is useful can be passed from parents to children than would have been the case if change had been less abrupt.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Intergenerational fractures have occurred in the past, as an extensive literature testifies, but today’s is unusually complete because of unprecedented changes related to a sharp rise in the productivity of labour and a change in the way leisure time is used. There is now more free time than working time. The emphasis has moved from work to consumption, from saving to spending, with a corresponding transformation of morals. This, indeed, is what has brought about the New Economy, and a marked re coding of personality.</Para>

              <Heading>Imprinting and “Cheap Talk”</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">We have dwelt in detail on imprinting in order to explain why in certain instances “cheap talk” takes off, while in others it remains mere hot air. A certain percentage of people in society are receptive to the new. If cheap talk falls on fertile imprinting ground, these people will easily overcome the inertia of an easy life and comprise an initiative group capable of growth. Since much “talk” is going on at any given moment, some of it will hit the target, like a bullet from a random burst of machine-gun fire. People need to be “hit” in this way because, for a group economy to function, a certain rate of renewal of communities is essential. New codes are devised so that, when a club becomes too full, its leaders can use them to partition themselves off again. From numerous alternatives, the one adopted is the one which meets an unconscious demand rooted in new imprints. A process is initiated in the social cauldron with its law of large numbers which it is difficult to replicate under laboratory conditions. Such an interpretation of innovation is at variance with the popular viewpoint, which sees novelties as a single, calculated shot from a sniper. In reality, the birth of innovations is a two-stage process of emission and filtration. The first phase is the production of trial offerings, while the second is collective selection. Creativity is itself a two-stage process. Ideas enter a person’s head and he mentally filters them until he arrives at an insight. To start a “talk” and present it to society for judgement is the first part of the task, and that is the responsibility of the inventor, the creative individual. No less important, however, is the second part where one particular “talk” is taken up out of the many. This is the stage at which social imprints come into play.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">A community develops its own system of filters, and until a happy combination of these is found a high-quality idea usually has to wait. Sometimes the moment is irrevocably lost. Just as a person with his bounded rationality makes do with an option which is satisfactory rather than ideal, so the community sometimes cannot wait for an ideal solution. An institutional trap appears: if some norm has become firmly established in practice, it is difficult for an innovation to displace it. If one scenario has been realised, it is difficult to move to another one, even if the latter is objectively better (Douglass North). In just the same way, people find it difficult to change their habits because they become encrusted with a host of other habits, practices, and obligations. The textbook example is the QWERTY keyboard which goes back to the days when mechanical typewriters were being distributed. More ergonomic keyboards have been proposed (for example, the COLEMAK layout), but we continue to use the old layout because everybody has got used to it. Today’s users prefer not to relearn. Manufacturers have to take account of this and block innovation, afraid of weak demand.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">It would be interesting to estimate the qualitative characteristics of imprinting and, in particular, to understand what is needed to get people to start the juggernaut of innovation moving. The sociology of fashion (and fashion is intimately linked to imprinting) enables us to estimate the number of groups which are potential carriers of a “virus”. Fashion innovators (those particularly susceptible to innovation) are approximately 2–3% of the market. After them come early adopters, 10–15%, then the fashion followers – up to 35%, and finally the laggards – 35%. The latter two groups, which comprise a total of 70% of the market, are those who will take up a trend in the course of a year to 18 months. The remaining 13%, conservatives, do not join in the game. It is not impossible that 2–3% (or thereabouts) is a universal number which determines the size of a target group receptive to “cheap talk”, not only in fashion but also in other areas. Thereafter the innovation is capable of spreading under its own steam.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">If we suppose that the 2–3% mentioned are sufficient to launch a variety of processes, the question arises of why precisely this number of adepts is capable of acting as a catalyst for subsequent steady growth. We may suppose that if an innovation has caught the imagination of 2 or 3 people out of every 100, then this will become known in one way or another to their close circle. Because this averages several dozen individuals for each of them, through direct interpersonal contacts news of the innovation will reach the whole 100, and everybody who so wishes will be able to sign up. Needless to say, to create the critical mass it is essential to have that many people so that, through word of mouth, they are able to inform the rest of society. If what we have said is true, then a decisive role in the fate of “cheap talk” is played by a horizontal information cascade, that is direct communication between people. The vertical flow of information also exercises an influence. If powerful information channels like television are mobilised, then in order to launch a horizontal cascade fewer than 2% may be needed, and if it is not, more than 3% may be required.</Para>

              <Heading>Imprinting and Advertising</Heading>
              <Para TextBreak="No">As noted above, economists explain branding in terms of “cheap talk”. Brand managers rely on imprinting, sometimes deliberately but more often intuitively. The credo of designer logos is to coincide with people’s latent expectations and transform the advertised good into a fetish. Spiderman, Bionicles from Lego, accessories for Barbie and other symbols of their time are directly inserted into people’s subconscious. To the same category belongs the marketing of food additives which are parasitic on the health cult, the preaching of pseudo-religious theories, and other more constructive phenomena. The stage is taken not by random goods and services, but by those which appeal to particular mindsets. Moreover, it is a matter not of the rational expectations of a particular quality, with which conventional marketing operates, but of slumbering, deep images. The interconnections are often far from obvious. For example, it is claimed by branding specialists that for North Americans personal independence is associated, amongst other things, with toilet paper. Accordingly, advertising for this associates it with other attributes of independence. Peanut butter is associated with maternal warmth; Swiss watches, Belgian chocolate, Russian kvass, Italian spaghetti, French cheese and Chanel’s little black dress are iconic goods different for each culture but deeply embedded in the system of associations.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">Imprint favourites are associatively linked with a number of other goods and draw them in their wake, lighting them up with their aura. When market researchers question people as to what they would like their next car to look like, the answers by no means cover everything that will really influence them at the moment of choice. They talk out loud about the size of the luggage compartment and the position of the air intake, but actually picture themselves in a brutal jeep, heedlessly careering across the prairie, or dream of a retro limousine, James Bond’s car, or an armoured car with the hatch raised. Their choice is determined by a cocktail of fantasy and common sense and, other things being equal, the company which gets the fantasies right is the one which makes the sale.</Para>
              <Para TextBreak="No">So when “cheap talk” engages with imprinting, the ignition fires. If we count up the total costs needed to bring these things triumphantly together, we will see that ultimately cheap talk works out far from cheap. Sometimes immense efforts and many attempts are needed to hit the G-spot and bond the image with subconscious aspirations. The weaker the message and the less accurate its targeting, the more repetition is needed to lodge it in people’s heads. Success comes not only to dazzling advertising campaigns but to many others. It just costs the less talented ones a whole lot more.</Para>

            <Heading>An Illustration From Science of Phase Transformations in the Community</Heading>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The plan of social innovations proposed needs further work and needs to be made more precise. In particular, the snowball analogy, on closer inspection, proves more delightful than accurate. The automatic further growth of communities after a critical mass of supporters has been reached is seen as self-evident, but real snowballs as they roll downhill increase only to a certain size, after which they cease to grow. Why, then, do social snowballs keep growing to avalanche proportions? The analogy looks only at the raw competitive advantage of the first snowball which deprives the others of snow, but the actual growth process is not considered at all. What does the critical mass depend on? Is the number of people in the community important or are there other factors?</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In order to answer these questions, let us resort to an illustration from natural science, from solid body physics. Such parallels are considered questionable, but nevertheless the restructuring of inanimate matter strikingly resembles the processes in society and helps us to make out what is going on. In some respects atoms do behave like living beings: they are not indifferent to their environment, they can change their neighbours, separate into groups with a different mutual disposition, and block off enclaves with barriers or borders. In a word, they can do the same things as people in a community. As a result of such restructuring, caused by a change in external conditions, a solid body alters its interior structure and attributes. One of the main mechanisms for such transformation is the engendering and growth of new embryos. That is, just as in society, within an inanimate system there arise hearths of growth with different attributes which gradually expand to restructure and reconfigure the initial matrix in their own image.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Physicists have given this process an explanation which may be of interest for the humanities. The first experimentally established element is the need for acquisition of a critical mass. Under particular conditions all the atoms of a substance are drawn to assume a new structure, but the only communities successful are those which have attained a certain size. Having done so, they begin to grow steadily. Those which have not reached the necessary mass are re-absorbed by the initial matrix. The growth of viable conglomerates continues until they encounter other conglomerates similar to themselves, engendered in a different hearth and developing in parallel. At that moment the process of transformation ends, since there is nowhere further to grow. All the atoms have been allocated to communities.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">Why do new embryos arise? This is explained by a gaining of energy in the new configuration (which results in a distance between the atoms being established which is optimal for the new conditions). Putting it very simply, in this new distribution the atoms feel better than they did in the old one, and if we extrapolate this explanation to the community, a better group environment arises. Why are not all conglomerates inclined to grow, but only those sufficiently large, when it would seem to be equally advantageous for all to restructure? The obstacle proves to be the new surface (returning to our lexicon, the boundary of the group). At the boundary the new formation comes into contact with the initial mass and a tension arises there. Always and everywhere the abutting of the new and the old results in a problem zone. If we are talking of people they, as it were, find themselves falling between two stools. And if we are talking about particles of matter, then if in the border regions between them the distance is not optimal, extra energy has to be expended to keep them in that position. A small growth hearth may have insufficient resources to build its own boundary, which is essential for separation. The new, harmoniously constructed volume grows by a cubic function from its width, while its surface grows quadratically. But as at the start the quadratic outpaces the cubic, so the forces of surface tension hold back initial growth.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">In other words, the larger the new formation, the fewer the number of its participants fated to live in the discomfort of the new frontier strip. Growth enters a steady phase when newbies immediately land in a favourable environment in such numbers that the heterogeneous neighbours have no impact. Until social density is sufficient, the ties of the past pull everything backwards.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">We have deliberately anthropomorphised a natural process in order to emphasise similarities. Let us return to the social coordinates. The analogy of the energy advantage which moves particles is, in respect of new social group formations, improved quality of communications. People join a group because they see potential quality time for themselves within it. The group grows unobstructed from the moment new recruits arrive in a more or less comfortable environment. The main thing the group economy should learn from our analogy is the role of boundaries. Creating these requires an upfront investment. Historians say, “The rich get richer because they are rich”. Correspondingly, the poor lock themselves inside a vicious circle of poverty. The analogy from physics allows us to develop this idea by pointing to the importance of barriers to growth.</Para>
            <Para TextBreak="No">The three mechanisms we have examined bring us to an understanding of how all sorts of doctrines, ideologies, beliefs, moral imperatives and the like crystallise out in the human mind and determine the behaviour of the masses and the course of history. “Cheap talk” gives rise to the “snowball”, which in turn brings about the formation of “superstars”, and the latter conquer hearts and minds which, for their part, are ready and waiting to be conquered. Social imprinting completes the chain and helps us to understand why one “talk” gets taken up while another does not.</Para>

          <Heading>Collaborative Filtering and the Prospects for Democracy</Heading>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Collaborative filtering can also have political applications. In economics, the theory of social choice (propounded by James Buchanan and Gordon Tullok) analyses political institutions. Attempting to expound it here would serve no purpose, but it will be helpful to outline how collaborative technologies can be applied in this sphere.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The basic idea is that universal, unhampered and unmediated socialising of each with each and of each with all brings about major changes in the nature of the electoral environment: its coherence, informational conductivity, activity and reactivity will be increased many times over. If people are given the tools to unite in meaningful coalitions, the quality of the electoral process is likely to improve markedly. Rules and procedures for forming institutions of government are firmly tied to communication facilities and the sophistication of the electorate, and accordingly there will be a powerful impulse towards transforming these institutions. It is worth considering how the political (electoral) toolkit would be renewed, and possibly beginning to redesign it in advance, and even start trialling it.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">If the technology of filtering had not been invented for resolving problems of consumer navigation in culture, it would need to be invented for developing democracy. We can detect the beginnings of collaborative filtering in the current procedures for elections: the electorate is grouped along territorial and party lines, although admittedly both are imperfect ways of aggregating interests. For example, living in the same region may imply a certain community of interests, but this is by no means total. Intellectuals in Kostroma and Vyatka may be far closer to each other than to their neighbours from other social strata. As regards the division into parties, it faces many people with a dilemma: whether to rally under the banner of the dissidents or abstain from voting. No small percentage of people chooses the latter of these two evils, finding no candidate they respect, or recognising that the one they do favour will not gain the necessary number of votes. In this way, their interests, and also the interests of others who voted for candidates who did not pass the prescribed threshold, are discriminated against. Possibly, if they lived in a region with a larger number of like-minded people, they would enjoy political representation. The party mechanism is also unsatisfactory because people do not know or understand the manifestoes, and the party leaders for their part do not know their supporters. Manifestoes are often a potpourri of “cheap talk”, and moreover not in an academic but in the everyday sense of the expression.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">For these and other reasons democracy works less well than it might. In the elections fewer political groups are participating than is essential for the process to work properly. Those which win prove unstable in their composition with the result that their work is less satisfactory. A political group is a means of aggregating the will of individuals and delegating it upwards for implementation. If the interests within the group are chaotic, they will cancel each other out and, instead of strength, what will be projected to the outside world is impotence (Mancur Olson). We can bring the ideal of democracy closer if we find a method of delivering political representation of many interest groups, each with its own clearly delineated interests. Then any citizen would have his own empowered representatives in the areas which matter to him, whether professional, educational, leisure, or other. Despite the utopian nature of the idea, it is gradually maturing in people’s minds. The point is that a person, being a multifaceted individual, could divide his vote between the leaders of several electoral associations he favoured, each of which would specialise in particular interests: ethnic, business, cultural or sport, as long as it could assemble a sufficient number of supporters. In order to participate in these coalitions, a person would need to subscribe a quota of personal resources to each of them, thereby registering the degree of his interest, and naturally he would have to decide to which organisations he needed to, and could afford to, belong. The number of interest groups cannot proliferate infinitely. The process of fragmentation of society into parties is self-regulating. Moreover, the real (solvent) demand for democracy is revealed, and the extent to which society can afford it becomes visible. As a result, a political system would emerge which consisted of many blocs crisscrossing the electorate, each representing different aspects of their voters’ interests. This scheme describes an extreme but imaginable development of democracy. The idyll is unlikely ever to be realised, not least because of the QWERTY effect, but it is nevertheless profoundly in harmony with the new group economy. Even if it will take a considerable time before actual moves in this direction occur, collaborative filtering (and we cannot do without it) will gradually begin to be enlisted in political practice. Since this is a technology for forming any group, it is in principle applicable also to political associations. One can foresee the following potential effects: (1) voters would group more meaningfully, since groups will be formed in full view of them; (2) a mutual adaptation of candidates to voters and vice versa would be observed.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">The creation of political groups is an unusual task to set collaborative filtering, and in order to perform it the technology will need to be modified. However, the underlying principle of establishing the proximity of people from the similarity of their experience and preferences is unchanged. In all the spheres for applying collaborative filtering which we have looked at up till now the talk was of “experience goods”, badly categorised and which it is simpler and cheaper to experience than to try working out what they amount to. A major consideration when choosing is taste. We might think political figures have a lot in common with experience goods, but they do not lend themselves to collaborative filtering. Candidates are hardly the equivalent of works of art, although the sympathies evoked by the screen and poster images in which they are presented to voters are almost decisive in terms of electoral results. Neither are cross recommendations a viable option, where proximity of taste neighbours’ preferences in other fields is transferred to politics. At least for the time being it is not clear which similarities could be used to ensure an appropriate transfer, although that is not to say that we may not discover such parallels in the future. To cap it all, if an election is being held there is no time for candidates to be “consumed” and rated by others, enabling their experience to be exploited, as is standard practice in collaborative filtering. Electing a governor or a president is not the same as choosing a book, if only because the act of electing is a one-off and the next attempt is far removed in time.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Another option might be to stitch together groups of politically like-minded people on the basis of their rating of political personalities, but this will not work either because the experience of consuming regional leaders and presidents is one-off and there is little carry over of relevant knowledge. If all electors in their lifetime saw at least a couple of dozen political personalities in the same political role, it might be possible to compile a profile from their ratings which would enable everything to proceed in accordance with the norms of collaborative filtering, but that is not the way things are. It is tempting to try to create a political profile of citizens from their attitude towards particular political events, but these would have to be electors who took a very close interest in political life.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">It is, nevertheless, possible to use a modified version of the collaborative method in the political process. This is obvious. The technology is part and parcel of the group economy and can be used to form groups of any description if we choose the right filters. The adaptation needed for politics is that what is needed is not a filtering of preferences (although they can and should be taken into account), but computation of proximity of the criteria people believe should be used to rate candidates. The collaborative system’s most basic ability is calculating proximity, and that can be computed on the basis of any assortment of characteristics, including political views.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">People could be grouped on the basis of what they want from politicians. Their expectations can be formulated in ordinary, readily comprehensible language, without complicated terminology and beginning with such basic coordinates as “left-right”, “socialism-capitalism”, “liberalism-statism”, “hawk-dove”. Suppose a list has been made of what is desired or required of candidates. The voter puts this in order of his personal priorities. It is fine if he chooses to ignore certain attributes, in just the same way that people do not have to have read exactly the same books in order for the system to compute proximity in terms of literature. The list could, for example, include such personal characteristics of the future leader as sex, age, charisma, pragmatism, managerial and political experience. It might include his proposals on financial and economic, social, industrial or fiscal policy. The characteristics could initially be provided by experts, but with time they would be augmented by points identified by voters themselves. This is precisely the way tag navigation on the internet is constructed, which consists of short marker phrases which users attach to particular materials. A user’s political profile would be compiled from the priorities he himself had indicated, and then fed in for standard processing by the collaborative algorithm. When a computer programme is calculating the proximity of series of numbers it is entirely indifferent to what the numbers stand for: the rating of art works or political demands. In one case the output will be reference circles based on aesthetic taste, and in the other similar circles of politically like-minded people.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">This modification of collaborative filtering is already being used to select consumer goods and services, particularly electronics and hotels. Take as an example the choice of a professional camera. The major considerations here are not only taste preferences, but also pragmatic aspects like price, the purposes for which and the conditions under which photographs are expected to be taken. The best advisers will be purchasers who were guided by the same considerations. It is, of course, also extremely helpful to discover what kind of considerations these were. It is from these people that the reference group should be drawn which will advise the user, and with which he will have the opportunity of socialising.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">This variety of collaborative filtering is also suitable for searching for professional literature, a task which to this day is coped with incredibly badly. When selecting proximate advisers, priority should be given not to past ratings (although that information is not irrelevant), but to the criteria the potential taste neighbour currently employs in selection. The publications may be cutting edge or popular, may attract readers by the style of their exposition or their interesting presentation, and may be of interest or not depending on the specific enquiry. The most valuable asset is the experience of people guided by the same considerations.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Using collaborative technologies in politics may have a number of useful spin-offs. For example, they can be used to establish how far a manifesto corresponds to groups’ aspirations, all by measuring the proximity of series of numbers which code priorities. This will make it easier for voters to see who they are voting for and why. It will also indicate the gap between the wishes of an individual and the pre-election platform of the activists of a group he is considering joining. There is a temptation to go beyond this and calculate the optimal manifesto – the one which best balances the aspirations of all the groups, – but this is likely to prove fruitless. Kenneth Arrow has shown that in a democracy it is impossible to calculate an optimum of social well-being which would equally satisfy everybody.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">What holds out the greatest promise, however, is the fact that in politics as nowhere else it is important to be informed and to have access to informed commentary, key elements of the New Economy. Group filtering throws light on much of what is emerging in the depths of society. The willingness of a person to join a particular group or party is directly affected by knowing how other people are reacting to information, and knowing their intentions. This is precisely the way we weigh up the prospects of a particular association. Election results depend not only on what people have heard about candidates and been told in their statements. No less important is whether they know who other people are going to vote for, and what considerations they are guided by. An admirably conceived group will not become popular if it does not show the requisite pace of growth. Good dynamic characteristics are in themselves a catalyst for voters.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Publicly available information about potential supporters of particular initiatives is decisive in determining the viability of civil and political associations. Before attempting to implement anything or joining any group, it is advisable to weigh up the likelihood of its attracting a sufficient number of supporters. Without that, all efforts will be wasted. An initiative may fail to take off, not because nobody is interested but purely because potential supporters are too dispersed. No businesslike initiative can afford not to attract the necessary social backing. The autocrats of old Russia were well aware of this secret and throughout Russian history kept socially active groups divided. When the favourites of the tsars were rewarded with lands, their patrimonies were scattered over an enormous area to prevent their owners acquiring a local power base.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">A mechanism publicising the rallying of society around particular initiatives will substantially raise the meaningfulness and quality of political processes. The internet with its communicative capabilities offers excellent tools to do just this. It is merely a matter of making use of them. For this rules and procedures are needed to make it possible to collect well thought out, responsible proposals from people wishing to participate in a particular project. Responsibilities should be allocated on a basis of being well informed, that is, having the ability to take account of other people’s intentions. Requirements for choosing knowledgeably include:<UnorderedList Mark="Dash">
              <ItemContent>
                <Para TextBreak="No">A comprehensible explanation of all proposals, including the cost of supporting them. This is needed to enable each individual to choose for himself what is most important and to direct his efforts intelligently;</Para>
              </ItemContent>
              <ItemContent>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Information about the minimum essential or optimal number of supporters required to make the project feasible and able to start;</Para>
              </ItemContent>
              <ItemContent>
                <Para TextBreak="No">Information online about the rate of increase of the number of people expressing a provisional intention of joining, and the “cost” of participating given the numbers currently listed.</Para>
              </ItemContent>
            </UnorderedList>
</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">It is critically important to state these conditions plainly and to make clear the moment at which a membership application assumes the form of a binding contract. Collaborative filtering is ideally suited to coping with these tasks, especially where it is desirable to know not only how many have signed up but also to have a deeper knowledge of who they are. If this kind of practice were adopted it would complicate the game of politics, but there is no simpler way apparent for balancing interests against each other without crushing any of the groups.</Para>
          <Para TextBreak="No">Two further important functions for the collaborative space are a 24/7 feedback channel for voters’ opinions, and a spokesperson for the feedback. Thus, a dynamic rating and reputation can be derived for the person eventually elected based on the online ratings of citizens which indicate how far actual policy is corresponding to pre-electoral promises. (This is clearly a threat for politicians.) It is also plain that collaborative filtering is a two-edged sword: knowing the views of the public may make it easier to pander to them. However, the strength of the institution is that (a) leaders will have to compete openly; (b) they will not be able to control a multi-million social arbiter.</Para>

              <Para>This study assessed the relationship between Deaf women's internal health locus of control (IHLC) and their cervical cancer knowledge acquisition and retention. A blind, randomized trial evaluated Deaf women's (<Emphasis Type="Italic">N</Emphasis> = 130) baseline cancer knowledge and knowledge gained and retained from an educational intervention, in relation to their IHLC. The Multidimensional Health Locus of Control scales measured baseline IHLC, and a cervical cancer knowledge survey evaluated baseline to post-intervention knowledge change. Women's IHLC did not significantly predict greater cervical cancer knowledge at baseline or over time. IHLC does not appear to be a characteristic that must be considered when creating Deaf women's cancer education programs.</Para>

              <Para>Cervical cancer is an increasingly controllable disease through prevention (sexual abstinence and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination), early detection (adherence to recommended screening guidelines for Pap tests), and prompt, appropriate treatment [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. Thus, women’s access to and use of cervical cancer knowledge and services are vital to their survival [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. Deaf women are among the minority groups that have been shown to experience barriers to accessing health information and services due to language and cultural barriers [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>]. This paper explores the relationship between Deaf women’s internal health locus of control (IHLC) and their possession, acquisition, and retention of cervical cancer knowledge.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec2">
                <Heading>Background on the Deaf Community</Heading>
                <Para>The Deaf community experiences many of the same language and cultural barriers to accessing health information and care as do other minority communities [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. The word Deaf with a capital “D” is used to signify those people who share a common language (American Sign Language (ASL)) and culture (Deaf culture), as opposed to a lower case “d” which is an audiological term. Within this community, English literacy levels average between fourth and fifth grade because English is learned as a second language, if it is learned at all [<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>]. Members of the Deaf community possess varying levels of ASL, lip reading, and note writing skills and combine their skills to achieve optimum communication.</Para>
                <Para>Compounding this literacy barrier is the severe shortage [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>] of healthcare professionals and public health educators who are proficient in ASL [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]. This makes the mainstream health education strategies less effective for the Deaf community than for the general public and can lead to misconstrued health information among Deaf individuals [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>]. The communication barriers experienced by Deaf women are compounded by cultural differences [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>-<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>] and mistrust of the medical system that further deter Deaf women from accessing vital health services [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef>]. These factors place Deaf women at greater risk for receiving medical care late for preventable or treatable illnesses and consequently, increase their odds of greater morbidity, sequelae, and mortality rates [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>].</Para>

                <Para>It has long been established that people’s perceived ability to control their health influences their efforts to accumulate and use health knowledge [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>]. Social learning theory predicts that people will participate in goal-directed behavior if they value the goal and believe that their actions will help them achieve that goal [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>]. Thus, a woman would be expected to seek information about a health-threatening illness if she values her health and believes that changing her behavior will lead to better health [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>]. People with a strong IHLC believe that their behaviors determine their health status. They are more likely to seek information about health-threatening conditions and engage in healthier behaviors, such as disease prevention, to maintain their health [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>]. Women with high IHLC, i.e., who believe that they control their own health, have been shown to be more likely to engage in cervical cancer screening [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>].</Para>

                <Para>Prior research has shown that minority women and women with disabilities are less likely to receive a Pap smear within the last 12 months or to have continuity in their medical care [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>]. A new cervical cancer education video (Cervical Cancer: Catch It Early and Save Your Life) was specifically developed to help Deaf women reduce their risk of discovering their cervical cancer at later stages by improving their access to cancer education. The information is presented in ASL with open captioning and voice-over in English so it can be shared with people who are hard of hearing, as well as hearing loved ones. It was made without competing background music to make the audio more accessible for people who are hard of hearing (<ExternalRef>

                <Para>Members of this research team recently published the results of a blind, randomized education trial to evaluate the impact of the partnership’s new cervical cancer education video among a cohort of Deaf women who rely upon ASL as their preferred mode of communication [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>]. Given the dearth of health education programs available in ASL, the women in the control group were offered the opportunity to cross over into the experimental group after completing their participation in the control group (see Fig. <InternalRef RefID="Fig1">1</InternalRef>. Crossover Study Design). Once they crossed over, the women from the control group followed the same protocol as the group of women who had been randomized into the experimental group. The study showed that once the women had viewed the video, their cervical cancer knowledge increased, and the increase was statistically, significantly greater than the pre- to post-intervention knowledge change for the control group before their crossover.

                <Para>The women in this study also completed an ASL version of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) scales, a widely used questionnaire that measures health-related control beliefs, including IHLC. In order to determine whether internality of health control beliefs influenced the acquisition of cervical cancer knowledge, the present study assessed the relationship between IHLC and cervical cancer knowledge for the sample of participants in both the original experimental group and the crossover experimental group combined. The relationship of IHLC to both baseline cancer knowledge and acquisition of knowledge following exposure to the cervical cancer education video were analyzed.</Para>

                <Para>The study team invited adult Deaf women from Southern California who used ASL as their preferred mode of communication to participate in the evaluation of an education program intended to improve the health and well being of the Deaf community, offered in ASL and supplemented with open captioning. At baseline, 130 Deaf women completed the written human subjects consent form required to join in the study; 58 were randomized to the control group and 72 to the experimental group. Two women in the control group were lost to follow-up and could not be located to learn their reasons for dropping out of the study. When the remaining 56 control group women were invited to cross over into the experimental group after completing their time in the control group, all of them did so, resulting in 128 women in the combined experimental group.</Para>

                  <Para>The MHLC scales measure health-related control beliefs [<CitationRef CitationID="CR33">33</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>]. The IHLC scale measures the strength of a person’s belief that he or she possesses control over his or her health. An ASL version of the MHLC scales was created and recorded on videotape via forward and backward translation and reconciliation [<CitationRef CitationID="CR35">35</CitationRef>] and validated [<CitationRef CitationID="CR36">36</CitationRef>]. As the result of confirmatory factor analysis that was conducted to establish the validity of the ASL version of the MHLC for use with members of the Deaf community, one of the original items (i.e., “When I get sick, I am to blame”) was removed from scoring of the IHLC subscale due to poor loading on the scale [<CitationRef CitationID="CR36">36</CitationRef>]. Thus, the IHLC scale score used in this study was based on five rather than the original six items. Each item is rated on a 6-point scale from 1 = “strongly disagree” to 6 = “strongly agree,” for a total IHLC score ranging from 5 to 30 points, with higher scores representing more internal control over health.</Para>

Five questions asked about general knowledge of cancer (e.g., Which cancer occurs the most often in women?); an additional eight true/false items tested knowledge about cancer and cervical cancer screening (e.g., Human papillomavirus or HPV is the virus that causes most cases of cervical cancer). A total score, representing the number of items answered correctly, was generated and used in the analysis. This total score has demonstrated validity (i.e., sensitivity to change) in the randomized controlled trial [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>].</Para>

                <Para>For purposes of analysis, higher and lower IHLC groups were created, based on a median split of the data for the IHLC scale (median = 25). Thus, those participants who scored 25 or above were deemed to have higher IHLC, and those scoring 24 or below were considered to have lower IHLC. Because of restricted range, this latter group of participants could not be considered to be truly low in IHLC; rather, the “lower” group average falls at about the midpoint of the scale, reflecting moderate internality of health control. A mixed model analysis was performed to analyze the repeated measures data of cervical cancer knowledge at baseline (i.e., first wave of data collection for all participants), at Time Two (i.e., immediately following the video intervention), and again at Time Three (i.e., 2 months after participants viewed the cervical cancer video intervention). Analyses were completed in SPSS 15 (Version 1.0). First, the main effect of higher IHLC (coded as values ≥25) relative to lower IHLC (coded as values ≤24) was examined in relation to participants’ baseline cervical cancer knowledge. The main effects of IHLC and time on cervical cancer knowledge at Time Two and Time Three were examined, with the significance of the interaction of time and IHLC of primary interest.</Para>

Approximately 1.6% of the women did not complete high school, 34.9% completed high school, 30.2% completed some college, 18.5% completed college, and 14.6% completed more than college. The ethnicity of the sample was Caucasian (58.1%), Hispanic (15.5%), Asian/Pacific Islander (9.3%), African American (5.4%), mixed (4.7%), and other (7.0%). IHLC scores ranged from 12 to 30 on the scale, with participants overall scoring an average of 24.49 (SD = 3.55).</Para>
                <Para>In mixed model analysis, IHLC did not predict higher baseline cervical cancer knowledge [<Emphasis Type="Italic">b</Emphasis> = 0.241; <Emphasis Type="Italic">F</Emphasis>(218.29) = 0.540, <Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis> = 0.463]; women with higher IHLC did not know more about cervical cancer at entry into the study. Also, the interaction of time and IHLC was not significant: IHLC did not predict attainment of more cervical cancer knowledge across time [<Emphasis Type="Italic">b</Emphasis> = −0.034; <Emphasis Type="Italic">F</Emphasis>(190.99) = 0.026, <Emphasis Type="Italic">p</Emphasis> = 0.871].

              <Para>Deaf women face greater challenges in accessing health information than women without a hearing deficit [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]. They have fewer opportunities to access health knowledge in ASL, and medical providers lack a cultural understanding of this population and its barriers in accessing health information [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>]. The Deaf community advocacy leaders in this partnership had expressed the concern that Deaf women may have significantly less access to cancer knowledge and care than hearing women. The ASL cervical cancer education video aimed to address that concern by delivering cancer information in a medium that is easy for this community to assimilate. By administering the MHLC as part of the research design, it was possible to examine the question of whether Deaf women’s strength of belief in personal control over their health (i.e., internal health locus of control) would influence their response to the cervical cancer education video.</Para>
              <Para>The results suggested that there was no demonstrable effect of internal health control beliefs on Deaf women’s baseline cervical cancer knowledge or knowledge gained after watching the video. IHLC predicted neither baseline levels of cervical cancer knowledge nor knowledge acquisition for Deaf women who viewed the cervical cancer video. However, as this study showed, the women did show increases in knowledge as a result of the educational intervention, supporting the premise that providing education in ASL would be beneficial for the Deaf women.</Para>
              <Para>Although the MHLC is frequently applied to the study of health knowledge and behaviors, in this study, IHLC did not explain the variability in health knowledge among participants, nor did it predict acquisition or retention of health information. However, most participants were quite high on IHLC. A median split was used to characterize participants with higher versus lower IHLC. This is a commonly used method of dividing samples, but it has limitations, especially when scores are negatively skewed, as they were in this sample. Therefore, it is possible that significant relationships between IHLC and health knowledge might be found in a sample with greater variability (i.e., including participants who were more truly external).</Para>
              <Para>This study had several limitations. The sample was relatively small, drawn from a single geographic region, and as with most research studies, the participants were more highly educated than the overall Deaf community. The study did not analyze issues, such as previous experiences with the medical system and demographic factors that can influence health control orientation and behaviors [<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>]. Also, due to the short time frame, the fairly wide variation in the time until recommended repeat screening based on medical and sexual history, and the lack of data regarding participants’ cervical cancer screening practices prior to the study, the study did not assess whether increased knowledge led to improvements in screening practices.</Para>
              <Para>The Deaf community is one of the minority populations frequently neglected in health promotion efforts [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>] and research studies. As a result, the Deaf community’s concerns, including less than optimal access to health information and care, are rarely addressed. This study showed the importance of conducting research on individual minority communities, especially the Deaf community, rather than assuming that results are translatable to diverse populations. It is increasingly being recognized that members of the Deaf community need to be offered health education material in a way that caters to their linguistic and cultural preferences. Such attention will ultimately empower them to take greater control of their health [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>].</Para>

              <Para>IHLC did not predict baseline knowledge or knowledge acquisition or retention for Deaf women who viewed a cervical cancer education video. Because the women were able to gain knowledge from an ASL video regardless of their IHLC, IHLC may not be an essential consideration when designing a cancer education program for Deaf women. However, now that there is a validated version of the MHLC in ASL, future studies should evaluate the impact of IHLC on cancer knowledge acquisition and retention with samples that have greater variability on IHLC, as well as examine other types of health-related control beliefs.</Para>

                <Para>This qualitative evaluation follows a randomized-control trial of a patient activation intervention in which hypertensive patients received a letter in the mail asking them to discuss thiazide diuretics with their provider. Results of the parent study indicated that the intervention was effective at facilitating discussions between patients and providers and enhancing thiazide prescribing rates. In the research presented here, our objective was to interview patients to determine their receptivity to patient activation, a potential leverage point for implementing interventions.</Para>

                <Heading>Methods</Heading>
                <Para>Semi-structured phone interviews were conducted with 54 patients, purposefully sampled from a randomized controlled trial of a patient activation intervention. All subjects had a history of hypertension and received primary care from one of twelve Veterans Affairs primary care clinics. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and reviewed by the interviewer. Interviews were independently coded by three qualitative researchers until consensus was attained, and relevant themes and responses were identified, grouped, and compared. NVivo 8.0 was used for data management and analysis.</Para>

                <Heading>Results</Heading>
                <Para>Data from this qualitative study revealed that most participants held favorable opinions toward the patient activation intervention used in the clinical trial. Most (82%) stated they had a positive reaction. Patients emphasized they liked the intervention because it was straightforward and encouraged them to initiate discussions with their provider. Also, by being active participants in their healthcare, patients felt more invested. Of the few patients offering negative feedback (11%), their main concern was discomfort with possibly challenging their providers' healthcare practices. Another outcome of interest was the patients' perceptions of why they were or were not prescribed a thiazide diuretic, for which several clinically relevant reasons were provided.</Para>

                <Heading>Conclusion</Heading>
                <Para>Patients' perceptions of the intervention indicated it was effective via the encouragement of dialogue between themselves and their provider regarding evidence-based treatment options for hypertension. Additionally, patients' experiences with thiazide prescribing discussions shed light on the facilitators and barriers to implementing clinical practice guidelines regarding thiazides as first-line therapy for hypertension.</Para>

              <Heading>Background</Heading>
              <Para>A communication gap frequently exists between physicians and patients regarding their healthcare decisions. Multiple studies have found physicians often assume a paternalistic role in their healthcare management of patients [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>]. In these types of interactions, patients tend to delegate all decision-making power to their providers, refraining from both expressing their concerns during medical visits and from asking questions pertaining to their healthcare [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>]; consequently, an exchange of information between patient and provider is limited. However, as recent studies have demonstrated, when patients and providers establish a collaborative relationship, that considers patient contributions and preferences, treatment may be more effective [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>One method of establishing this bidirectional therapeutic decision-making process is by means of patient-activated interventions [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]. Such interventions work to increase patient involvement in personal healthcare through patient education and skill-building, often targeted toward patients initiating specific conversations with their providers. These interventions promote a bidirectional interaction between providers and patients. A critical element in this model is how to motivate patients to inquire about or request the promoted therapy or service. One approach widely utilized in marketing is direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising via mass media portals, including television and magazine advertisements and personalized direct mail [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>]. While DTC advertising is considered controversial in the medical field [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>], it can serve as a useful tool for consumers to become active team members in the management of their healthcare. Patient activation seeks to utilize elements of direct-to-consumer advertising by incorporating aspects of social marketing [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>] to promote evidence-based therapies rather than brand-specific pharmaceuticals. These interventions could be a critical component of implementing guideline-concordant therapy in a consumer-driven healthcare approach [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>], yet little is known about patients' receptivity to such an intervention.</Para>
              <Para>In this paper, we describe patient perspectives of a patient activation intervention to encourage patients to talk with their primary care provider about initiating clinical practice guideline-concordant therapy (<Emphasis Type="Italic">i.e</Emphasis>., thiazide diuretics) for hypertension. A complementary paper examines provider perspectives of the same intervention [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>]. These patients and providers were part of a randomized control trial that found the intervention increased the likelihood of patients discussing a thiazide diuretic with their provider and the likelihood that providers would prescribe the medication [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>]. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two stakeholder groups--patients and primary care providers--to give them the opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention from their own point of view. These two qualitative studies are first steps in systematically examining how to modify this patient activation intervention to more effectively engage all involved. The provider study places the intervention in the larger context of strategies to implement clinical practice guidelines with a focus on hypertension and prescribing behavior. The patient study looks more closely at how patients viewed their role in the intervention as initiators of guideline-concordant therapy. Together they provide a more comprehensive picture of how the intervention worked in practice and point to ideas to improve its effectiveness for future implementation studies and interventions.</Para>
              <Para>The primary objective of this study is to determine participants' perceptions of a patient-activated intervention, particularly its acceptability and effectiveness through the eyes of the patients. Understanding patients' receptivity to this approach, their motivations for participation, and their perspective of their roles in the intervention may improve the implementation of patient activation strategies to promote clinical practice guidelines, as well as enhancing a collaborative approach between patients and providers.</Para>

                <Heading>Participants, intervention, and recruitment</Heading>
                <Para>We conducted semi-structured interviews with 54 veterans with hypertension, recruited from a larger group of 532 veterans participating in a hypertension study at the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) in Iowa City, IA and Minneapolis, MN [<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef>]. All patients in the study received primary care at one of these two facilities or through one of their community-based outpatient clinics (five in IA, five in MN). The parent study involved a randomized controlled trial of a patient activation intervention to encourage hypertensive patients to speak with their provider about obtaining a prescription for a thiazide diuretic, first-line therapy for hypertension. The objective of the parent study was to change provider prescribing behavior and increase implementation of clinical practice guidelines. Patients were randomized to a control arm or one of three intervention arms who received: (arm A) an individualized letter discussing their latest blood pressure, their 10-year cardiovascular risk score, and education about the value of thiazides; (arm B) the same individualized letter plus an offer of a $20 financial incentive if they talked with their provider about a thiazide prescription, and, if applicable, a copayment reimbursement for six months ($48) if prescribed a thiazide; and (arm C) the individualized letter, the financial incentive, plus a phone call from a health educator to answer questions about the intervention. Patients were asked to return a postcard (themselves or by giving it to their provider to complete) indicating whether they talked with their provider about their hypertension, whether they were prescribed a thiazide diuretic, and, if not, their understanding of their provider's rationale for not initiating thiazide treatment.</Para>
                <Para>Patients for the semi-structured interviews were recruited according to a purposeful stratified sampling design by site (IA or MN), intervention arm (A, B, C), and whether or not they were prescribed a thiazide diuretic. Patients were identified as being prescribed a thiazide diuretic or not through review of the electronic medical record. The study team also attempted to interview all patients who returned a postcard stating they chose not to bring in the letter (n = 7). We conducted these interviews outside the stratified sampling design to gain more insight into why patients chose not to participate in the intervention. We completed three of the possible seven interviews with patients who indicated on the postcard that they chose not to bring in the letter. The other four were unable to be reached for follow-up.</Para>

                <Heading>Interviews</Heading>
                <Para>Open-ended, semi-structured interview guides were developed for each arm of the study to cover variation in patient activation strategies. A semi-structured approach was chosen to minimize variation among interviewers and to facilitate a systematic means of gathering data and conducting analysis of responses, while at the same time allowing for individualized follow-up depending on the content of the interview [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>]. Interview guides were evaluated and revised periodically throughout the study period as analysis evolved and new themes emerged. During the interviews, lasting an average of 16 minutes (range: 9-46 minutes), veterans were asked about their: opinions of the intervention, factors affecting their decision regarding whether or not to bring in the letter, conversation with their healthcare provider about thiazides, understanding of why they were or were not prescribed a thiazide, and opinions of financial incentives. Field notes were completed immediately after each interview using a standardized template.</Para>
                <Para>After conducting the first set of interviews, the lead qualitative researcher (HSR) trained two research assistants (RHB, MW) to conduct the subsequent interviews. The interviews were conducted within two weeks of the primary care visit in which patients were asked to bring in the letter. One exception was patients who sent in postcards marked 'no I did not talk to my doctor.' These interviews were attempted as soon as the qualitative interviewers were made aware of their return. The interviews took place over a nine-month period from March to December 2007. All interviews were completed by telephone, except for one completed in person, and recorded on digital voice recorders. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and reviewed against the original recording by the interviewer prior to importation into NVivo 8, a qualitative data management and analysis software program [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>]. Interviewer field notes were also imported into NVivo for analysis and comparison. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Iowa City and Minneapolis VAMCs and the respective VA Research and Development Committees.</Para>

                <Para>Coding analysis consisted of three stages: data collection and thematic content analysis occurring simultaneously; detailed analysis of the thematic codes; and matrix analysis of codes. The first stage was an iterative process with coding analysis and data collection occurring simultaneously and informing both the evolving interview guide and coding dictionary [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef>]. After conducting the first set of interviews, the lead qualitative researcher (HSR) and a research assistant (MW) read through the transcripts, made notes on preliminary coding, and developed a thematic coding scheme with definitions. This coding 'dictionary' was routinely reviewed and refined throughout the data collection process as new themes emerged. After the initial dictionary was developed, each transcript was independently coded by a minimum of three individuals from the research team (HSR and trained research assistants, RHB, MW, and/or RG). They then met as a team to compare their impressions and code the transcript by consensus within NVivo. Weekly consensus coding was performed in an effort to increase the validity and reliability of the coding by refining the content boundaries of the codes and making coding more consistent. An audit trail was kept in NVivo. At the end of the data collection and analysis, the coding dictionary contained 18 thematic codes. As new codes were added to the coding dictionary, previous transcripts were coded for content related to the new codes.</Para>
                <Para>In the second coding stage, detailed analysis of the original thematic codes was performed and content sub-coded into related subcategories [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>] resulting in 31 additional sub-codes. In stage three, matrix analyses [<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>] of a set of sub-codes focused on several specific questions, including: 'What did you think about the letter and what it asked you to do?' 'What made you decide to take the letter with you to your appointment rather than just leaving it at home?' 'What would you say was the main reason that you were (not) prescribed a diuretic?' Two coders (SP, MW) independently coded each participant's response to the questions based on the specific question. For example, the question regarding participants' opinions of the intervention letter were coded to one of the following mutually exclusive categories: positive, neutral, negative, or no response. Disagreements were resolved through a third coder (HSR) who acted as a tiebreaker. These questions were coded by mutually exclusive discreet categories to allow for a structured presentation of the distribution of responses of the participants. To maintain consistency, only responses patients gave directly after the question was asked were coded.</Para>

              <Para>The mean age of our study sample was 65.1 years, 98% were male, and 76% had a copayment for their medications (Table <InternalRef RefID="Tab1">1</InternalRef>). Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between those included in the qualitative study and the larger study sample. The one notable difference between the groups was the higher proportion of semi-structured interview participants were prescribed a thiazide. This difference was intentional due to the decision to stratify by prescription outcome in an effort to better understand the main outcome of the parent study. Results of the parent study indicate the intervention was effective at facilitating discussions between patients and providers and enhancing thiazide prescribing rates [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>].<Table Float="Yes" ID="Tab1">

Five of the respondents reported they followed through with what the letter asked them to do because they wanted to be a part of the study to benefit other veterans.

Frankly, I have tried--I've been on high blood pressure medication for approximately thirty years. So way back when, you know, [we tried] various deals including, the water pill, and finally we came up with this, Adelat [nifedipine] 60 milligrams. And, it's working great. So, I, told my doctor actually, I'd say PA, 'Well, unless you have, a great reason for changing, the [Adalat] is working good, let's not upset the apple cart,' and she agreed a hundred percent.'

I have been on diuretics before. I told him that in the history of my blood pressure I tried several different drugs prescribed by my local physician in order to try to get a handle on it and that I was satisfied with where I was at right now.

                  <Para>Patients who were not prescribed a thiazide often had developed arguments for why they should not be prescribed, including documentation of home blood pressure readings and histories of previous diuretic prescriptions.

              <Heading>Discussion</Heading>
              <Para>The results presented indicate that a patient activation intervention was perceived by most patients as a positive and effective tool for increasing bidirectional interactions with their primary care providers and for implementing evidence-based guideline therapy. The acceptability of the intervention was demonstrated by the positive feedback received from a majority (83%) of the participants. For most patients, it was viewed as a straightforward tool to help them engage in conversation with their provider about information specific to the treatment of their hypertension. In addition, patients provided insight as to why the intervention was effective in increasing participation in the intervention. Many of their answers pointed toward findings consistent with previous studies that have established the efficacy of utilizing a collaborative approach to healthcare [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>], which further reinforces the positive role patients can play in the promotion of guideline-based care of hypertension.</Para>
              <Para>Patient responses detail some factors of patient activation interventions that appear to be important for their acceptability and effectiveness. First, providing patients with a straightforward, clearly written informational letter with a specific request offered them an opportunity to candidly discuss alternatives to treating their hypertension. Some patients went so far as to say it 'empowered' them or gave them permission to actively engage in conversation with their provider without being perceived as demanding. By having the letter in hand, patients' felt an added sense of validation for the queries they were presenting, which may have been particularly beneficial for patients who were reluctant to take a more active role in their interactions with their providers. A sizable portion stated they brought the letter in to become more knowledgeable regarding treatment options. Thus, the language of the intervention letter seemed to be expressed in a manner that was agreeable to both those who learned from the letter and those who used it as a means to learn more from their provider. These findings suggest that some patients may be hesitant to pursue detailed medical information from their provider--despite a desire--without aide from a trusted, external source, which well-designed patient activation interventions can provide.</Para>
              <Para>The results from this paper and the parent study emphasize that most patients in the study were willing and interested in taking a proactive approach to their healthcare [<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>]. Other work by our group has shown that differences in patient role-orientation were independent of willingness to comply with the patient activation intervention [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>]. In other words, patients who valued active engagement with their providers liked the intervention because it gave them a trusted tool to do so. On the other hand, patients who preferred to remain more passive in the clinical encounter also liked the intervention because they could just provide the information to their providers, while leaving the decision in their hands.</Para>
              <Para>At the same time, it is clear that one size does not fit all when it comes to promoting patient engagement in healthcare. For a minority of patients, the intervention made them uncomfortable because they perceived the letter as questioning their provider's judgment. One way to ease the discomfort of some patients may be to specifically discuss the decision-making process in the letter, reassuring some patients that the intervention may encourage discussion between patients and providers, but ultimately the healthcare provider can make the final decision. Another approach could be to inform providers at the clinics of the letters and tell patients the providers are aware they may bring them to their visit. This could ease patients' discomfort if they know providers are prepared for the letters; however, this may also reduce the effectiveness of the intervention in prompting the providers. Future studies should address different ways of presenting clinical guideline information to patients--and providers.</Para>
              <Para>The influence of military or VA culture was seen throughout patient responses. These findings are consistent with work conducted by Campbell and colleagues [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>] regarding altruistic propensities of veterans in regards to volunteering for clinical trials. Their experiences with military culture and active duty service appear to embed core values such as altruism, stewardship, and a propensity to follow orders. Within the margins of this study, numerous patients' mentioned altruistic factors that influenced their receptiveness to and positive perceptions of the intervention. Responses also indicated a willingness to participate in the study and follow-through until completion with the goal of helping others. Additionally, many patients specified ethical motivations for participating in the study and for bringing in the letter for discussion. For several patients it was their way of 'paying back' the military and other veterans, while others were merely 'following orders', suggesting that some former service members still believe they have a duty to abide by direct orders.</Para>
              <Para>These findings raise two issues for future implementation of this and similar interventions. First, would a patient activation intervention be as acceptable and effective in a non-VA population? Some veterans in this study stated they brought in the letter simply because it told them to do so. VA clinics may have patients who are more likely to comply with this type of intervention and the request to bring in the letter. However, as discussed previously, this patient activation intervention had appeal for a wide-variety of reasons beyond a sense of obligation and could potentially appeal to non-VA populations as well. The second issue is that the sense of obligation to participate in the intervention appeared to have increased because it was also a research study. This issue has important implications for implementation research as we seek to study the effects of an intervention in clinical practice--beyond the efficacy of a clinical trial. How do we separate the influences of participating in a study from the decision to participate in an intervention?</Para>
              <Para>Finally, the results demonstrate the variety of roles patients played in the intervention. Some wanted to be informed healthcare consumers, including understanding why they are or are not prescribed a thiazide diuretic. Not all patients want to be active in the decision-making process. Some want to be informed about why they are receiving certain treatments, while others relied on the adage 'my doctor knows best.' Interestingly, even those who did not want to be part of the decision-making process still brought in the letter to have the conversation with their provider. Therefore, the emphasis on bidirectional interaction is not only about patients who want to be involved in the decision-making process, but also for patients who want to be informed--or to simply comply. The responses can also be compared to provider responses regarding why they chose to prescribe a thiazide to their patients [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>]. The comparison may provide insights into the barriers to prescribing thiazides as a first-line therapy for hypertension. These barriers include the interaction between both stakeholder groups. For example, some patients in the study come in with their home blood pressure readings--and an argument for why they should not be prescribed a thaizide.</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec35">
                <Heading>Limitations</Heading>
                <Para>There are several limitations of this study. First, the study was restricted to a sample of predominately white male VA patients. The findings may be unique to the VA, as many veterans appear to exhibit a sense of obligation that may influence their participation in and perception of the interventions. This also raises questions for implementation research, which seeks to understand the effects of an intervention outside of research contexts. Secondly, we only interviewed four patients who did not discuss the letter with their providers. The choice to focus on the main outcome of the parent study (prescription of a thiazide) limited our ability to examine why patients chose not to bring in the letter; however, prescription of a thiazide was the most timely and reliably documented outcome by which to stratify for the qualitative sample. The likelihood is that the parent study actually underestimates the number of people who brought in the letter, and that the qualitative study over-emphasizes the acceptability of the intervention to patients. Another methodological limitation is that it is difficult to interpret the influence of the separate intervention arms due to our decision to collapse in the presentation of findings. However, based on an analysis of the matrix coding by arm of intervention, the arm of the patient's participation does not appear to affect their evaluation of the letter or patients' motivations for bringing in the letter. Equal numbers of patients who were prescribed a thiazide and who were not prescribed a thiazide were recruited in each arm, so it is difficult to evaluate qualitatively whether there were systematic differences by arm. It also illustrates the 'messy' nature of real-world implementation and the inability to capture every scenario to describe success or failure of an intervention. Nevertheless, we included the arm with each of the quotes for the reader's interpretation, although we recognize the readers do not have the advantage of seeing the depth of quotes and their consistency across arms. Finally, as noted in the tables, several participants' answers were missing. In large part, this is due to our decision to restrict matrix coding only to very specific question/response segments. The missing answers do not appear to be systematic.</Para>

              <Heading>Summary</Heading>
              <Para>The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the acceptability of a patient-activated intervention from the patients' perspective. Patients along a spectrum of role orientations appreciated the intervention as a trusted tool to engage their providers in an informed discussion about hypertension treatment options and clinical guidelines. Insight into how patients perceived the intervention strategy may serve to assist in the design of future low-cost interventions to improve the management of chronic diseases in VA and other health systems and have potential value to clinical administration leaders who are responsible for improving the quality of care. The patient activation strategy was acceptable to most patients, served as a tool to engage patients in a more active role, and seemed to promote greater patient-provider interaction.</Para>

                <Para>Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is widely used throughout the UK and the Western world. CAM is commonly used for children and the decision-making process to use CAM is affected by numerous factors. Most research on CAM use lacks a theoretical framework and is largely based on bivariate statistics. The aim of this review was to identify a conceptual model which could be used to explain the decision-making process in parental choice of CAM.</Para>

                <Heading>Methods</Heading>
                <Para>A systematic search of the literature was carried out. A two-stage selection process with predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria identified studies using a theoretical framework depicting the interaction of psychological factors involved in the CAM decision process. Papers were critically appraised and findings summarised.</Para>

                <Heading>Results</Heading>
                <Para>Twenty two studies using a theoretical model to predict CAM use were included in the final review; only one examined child use. Seven different models were identified. The most commonly used and successful model was Andersen's Sociobehavioural Model (SBM). Two papers proposed modifications to the SBM for CAM use. Six qualitative studies developed their own model.</Para>

                <Heading>Conclusion</Heading>
                <Para>The SBM modified for CAM use, which incorporates both psychological and pragmatic determinants, was identified as the best conceptual model of CAM use. This model provides a valuable framework for future research, and could be used to explain child CAM use. An understanding of the decision making process is crucial in promoting shared decision making between healthcare practitioners and parents and could inform service delivery, guidance and policy.</Para>

              <Heading>Background</Heading>
              <Para>There is considerable debate around the definition of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>], definitions varying over time[<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]. CAM can be defined as "any health improving technique outside of the mainstream of conventional medicine"[<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]. One of the most recent definitions divides CAM into mind-body medicine, biologically based therapies, manipulative and body-based systems and energy medicine, and whole system approaches such as Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine[<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>CAM is very popular, with recent population based estimates of yearly adult use in the UK of 20% – 28%[<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>] and 34% – 38% in the USA [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. A systematic review of CAM prevalence surveys worldwide found a prevalence of between 23% – 62%, and for over the counter CAM 25% – 46%[<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>]. CAM is also commonly used for children, with prevalence estimates from 12% in the USA[<CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>], 11% in Canada[<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>] to 51% in Australia[<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>]and 17.9%[<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>] to 37%[<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>] in the UK. There is evidence that home remedies are also commonly used for children in the UK[<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>As in making choices about conventional care treatments, in choosing CAM there are numerous considerations to take into account. Such considerations revolve around the personal perception of the balance between expected drawbacks of action (e.g. side effects) and the anticipated benefits of the treatment[<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>]. Within this vast continuum, the variables which will impact on the decision making process include desires (utilities associated with each alternative, personal values, goals, etc), beliefs (expectations about processes and outcome, knowledge, means to achieve desired outcome etc)[<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>] and other practical considerations (e.g. access). Decision making in healthcare may be moving from paternalism to autonomy, finally settling on shared decision making and 'consumerism'[<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>In addition, the decision making process for child health is different to that of adults as it may include the whole family not just the patient[<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>]. Decisions are often made by parents, not the child although there is debate around the role of children, with the model of constrained parental autonomy suggesting that parents make decisions for their children but this autonomy is not absolute[<CitationRef CitationID="CR21">21</CitationRef>]. Family centred care is now a central tenet of healthcare, particularly nursing[<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef>], although a recent literature review found that despite the importance of including children in decision making on their own health they are rarely involved in the decision making process[<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>]. Regarding CAM use, particularly for certain ethnic minority groups, children may be even less autonomous than in other areas[<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>]. Adolescents however are likely to have a greater degree of autonomy, using CAM due to personal beliefs and control[<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>] Parents may use CAM to be a 'good' parent, particularly for children with a serious illness[<CitationRef CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef>]. In addition parents may not use the same treatments for children as for themselves, including home remedies[<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>]. Parents may be more cautious with children's health, trusting and visiting practitioners more readily and taking caution in using home remedies[<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>]. However, they may also feel more strongly dissatisfied with conventional healthcare for their child than for themselves[<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>]. In addition, females are higher users of healthcare service[<CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>], and mothers are more likely to use CAM for their children than fathers[<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>], indicating that mainly mothers are involved in decision making.</Para>
              <Para>There is a large amount of literature written on the decision-making process in conventional care but the extrapolation of the conventional medicine (CM) decision-making process to CAM choices is debatable[<CitationRef CitationID="CR33">33</CitationRef>]. The process of choosing to use CAM may be far more dynamic, iterative and more individualistic than the more logical and rational decisions in conventional care[<CitationRef CitationID="CR33">33</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>The literature about choosing to use CAM encompasses many different approaches. Many studies have identified the factors associated with CAM use in children in the UK[<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR35">35</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR36">36</CitationRef>], the USA[<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR42">42</CitationRef>] and Canada[<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR43">43</CitationRef>]. However, much of the research into reasons for using CAM so far has been atheoretical and lacks a clear and comprehensive conceptual framework to contain and explain the processes which are inherent in CAM decision-making[<CitationRef CitationID="CR44">44</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR45">45</CitationRef>]. Most of the studies are based on survey methods, are cross-sectional and cannot determine directional relationships[<CitationRef CitationID="CR46">46</CitationRef>]. In recent years there has been a move to explain the mechanisms which motivate and actualise the choice of CAM.</Para>
              <Para>This review examines the literature relating to the decision-making process in CAM, but excludes models which do not include psychosocial factors or affective values or beliefs such as computational models of decision making, the cognitive processes involved in decision making (e.g. Hypothetico-deductive model[<CitationRef CitationID="CR47">47</CitationRef>]) and other descriptive theories of the decision making process which relate to treatment choices (e.g. Prospect theory[<CitationRef CitationID="CR48">48</CitationRef>]). This review focuses on the decision which leads to choosing CAM; as such it concerns itself with the models which attempt to explain the choice of complementary or alternative healthcare and the psychosocial factors that are involved in this decision.</Para>
              <Para>Two dominant approaches have been used to study decision-making in CAM: the first originates in the concept of healthcare utilisation, concerned with the factors which enable and encourage the consumption of health services. The second approach views the decision to use CAM as a health behaviour, where the decision to use CAM is viewed within the framework of social and psychological, mainly cognitive, factors.

Attitudes include beliefs and expectations about a particular behaviour and the extent to which consequences are seen as desirable. Subjective norms are the beliefs one has about the expectations of 'significant others' and the motivation to comply with these. Perceived behavioural control is the extent to which one expects the behaviour to be easy or difficult and whether they perceive themselves to have the ability to carry out such a behaviour – often equated with self efficacy</SimplePara>

                <Para>The decision leading to choice of healthcare can be modelled by pathway (sequential), or determinants models[<CitationRef CitationID="CR49">49</CitationRef>]. Pathway models give stages of healthcare seeking, moving from self-care, adoption of the sick role, seeking medical care and finally recovery[<CitationRef CitationID="CR49">49</CitationRef>]. Determinants models focus on explanatory factors of the choices made[<CitationRef CitationID="CR49">49</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>The main determinants model is Andersen's sociobehavioural model (SBM)[<CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR50">50</CitationRef>], particularly prominent in the (conventional) medicine literature[<CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>]. This model sets out three sequential components which mitigate healthcare use; predisposing, enabling and need factors[<CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>]. A recent addition to the model is the role of social support, whereby social influence can encourage the utilisation of healthcare as well as the perception of the efficacy of a given treatment[<CitationRef CitationID="CR50">50</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>The Consumer Decision-Making model which is less often used for healthcare has three components: external influences, the consumer decision-making process and the post decision behaviour[<CitationRef CitationID="CR51">51</CitationRef>].</Para>

                <Heading>Health behaviour models</Heading>
                <Para>Health behaviour models take into account psychological influences on behaviour and thus explain the individual differences in behaviour, but often do not take account of external characteristics such as sociodemographic variables. Within this approach there are various models which have been applied to health behaviours, such as the Health locus of Control (HLoC), the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), the Transtheoretical model (Stages of change) (TTM) and the Self-Regulatory model (SRM).</Para>
                <Para>The concept of HLoC originates in Attribution Theory [<CitationRef CitationID="CR52">52</CitationRef>] and relates to the extent to which individuals view events as under their control (an internal locus of control) or out of their control (external locus of control). HLoC has been widely applied in the health and other arenas [<CitationRef CitationID="CR53">53</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR54">54</CitationRef>], based on the prediction that individuals high in internal locus of control are more likely to carry out health-promoting behaviours, whereas those with high external locus of control who attribute their health to chance will be unlikely to engage in health-enhancing activities [<CitationRef CitationID="CR55">55</CitationRef>]. The TTM was originally developed as a charting of the processes engendered in the elicitation and maintenance of change during the therapeutic process [<CitationRef CitationID="CR56">56</CitationRef>] and has been used for various health behaviours. The theory of planned behaviour[<CitationRef CitationID="CR57">57</CitationRef>] attempts to explain behavioural intentions as predicted from three major sources: attitudes, perceived behavioural control and subjective norms. The SRM was formulated to describe the process whereby when confronted with a health threat, individuals seek overcome the problem and return to normality.</Para>
                <Para>This paper presents the results of a systematic review to identify how these models have been applied to the prediction of CAM use, and focuses on their potential use for children. The paper discusses the methods used in the literature search, followed by the results which discuss the quality of the papers found and their conclusions regarding the suitability of the model they test.</Para>

                <Para>At the second selection stage the inclusion criteria were that the paper had to present a <Emphasis Type="Italic">model</Emphasis> of factors associated with the utilisation or choice of CAM. This was done by screening each paper for the key word 'model' or 'theory' and determining their use or reference to a model within the article (excluding the term 'regression model' and 'integrative model/integrative care model'). The term model was occasionally used in reference to a <Emphasis Type="Italic">paradigm</Emphasis>, rather than the intended use as in a theoretical framework which depicts a process of sorts; when this occurred it was necessary to exclude such studies.</Para>

                <Heading>Design</Heading>
                <Para>Out of 22 studies surveyed, 16 used quantitative approaches to examine the models in question. Six studies [<CitationRef CitationID="CR71">71</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR73">73</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR77">77</CitationRef>] used qualitative methodology. In the initial search, many studies were identified which used qualitative methodology to examine the subject of predictors or correlates of CAM use, however in the subsequent analysis these had to be excluded due to lack of use of a model.</Para>
                <Para>All the studies, excluding one [<CitationRef CitationID="CR67">67</CitationRef>] used a cross-sectional design. The main disadvantage of such a design is that cause and effect cannot be determined in spite of collection of a large amount of variables. This often resulted in largely correlational datasets, which, while being informative and to some extent predictive, fail to provide a causal model of CAM decision-making and to identify the exact mechanisms through which CAM choices are made. Only one study examined the propensity for CAM use over two time points, thereby assigning specific causal relationships to use of CAM[<CitationRef CitationID="CR67">67</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>One major advantage of a number of studies was that they used the frequency of CAM use as a variable to compare specific predictors of more or less use. By doing this they were able to distinguish between the beliefs which differentiated a person who tried CAM but did not have a committed treatment plan [<CitationRef CitationID="CR58">58</CitationRef>].</Para>

                <Heading>Sampling</Heading>
                <Para>The majority (10) of studies surveyed had medium sized samples of between 123 and 551, indicating attempts to achieve a representative population. Of the studies using self-selection there was a predominance of female respondents, usually because females were more likely to use health services [<CitationRef CitationID="CR78">78</CitationRef>] and more likely to use or consider using CAM [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR79">79</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR81">81</CitationRef>]. Some studies were specifically aimed at the experience of females only, mainly in relation to breast cancer and other female-dominated diseases [<CitationRef CitationID="CR61">61</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR64">64</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR72">72</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR73">73</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR75">75</CitationRef>], one included males only (prostate cancer)[<CitationRef CitationID="CR76">76</CitationRef>]. Other studies based on large scale, often national, studies had much larger samples of between 1672 and 31,044 so were able to pursue a more representative sample in most cases. Qualitative studies had much smaller samples, between 16 and 42, which is appropriate for their methodology.</Para>
                <Para>Overall, the response rate for most studies was highly acceptable at 60% or higher for most studies[<CitationRef CitationID="CR82">82</CitationRef>]. This serves to enhance the reliability of the findings in terms of their generalisability. However, for a few studies there was very low response rate, which would indicate that it was unlikely that the sample was representative of the population concerned[<CitationRef CitationID="CR44">44</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR60">60</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR62">62</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>Most studies only included adults, most defined as over 18, but some with limited age ranges[<CitationRef CitationID="CR65">65</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR70">70</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR71">71</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR76">76</CitationRef>].

                <Heading>Measures and analyses</Heading>
                <Para>Most of the quantitative studies included in this review tended to use measures which were largely found to be reliable and valid. This was often established in previous studies which used the same measures. In some cases, the reliability of the measures was tested through internal consistency (Cronbach ά) and multi-item responses used to establish reliability within the studies. Aside from the qualitative studies and a number of the surveys, many of the studies were self-report questionnaires, which are open to biases in the form of response bias, demand characteristics and to the introduction of systematic errors.</Para>
                <Para>The qualitative studies used semi structured or open ended interviews. They also tended to use methods which attest to the integrity and validity of the data such as confirming the findings with participants. One qualitative study tested the predictability of the model they developed[<CitationRef CitationID="CR71">71</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>The quantitative studies predominately used multivariate logistic regression or multinomial logit regression to explain the relative variance of each of the factors significant in the decision making process although some analyses were limited to bivariate or correlational association[<CitationRef CitationID="CR59">59</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR66">66</CitationRef>]. The qualitative studies used either grounded theory[<CitationRef CitationID="CR73">73</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR75">75</CitationRef>], or 'thematic' analysis[<CitationRef CitationID="CR74">74</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR76">76</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR77">77</CitationRef>].</Para>

                <Heading>Limitations of the studies</Heading>
                <Para>Many studies did not distinguish between different types of CAM, which may have significant implications given that those studies that did differentiate CAM type found that the decision making process did vary for the different CAM modalities[<CitationRef CitationID="CR66">66</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR68">68</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR70">70</CitationRef>]. Some studies were unclear about what was included in their definition of CAM[<CitationRef CitationID="CR67">67</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR72">72</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>Not all studies controlled for factors which may have biased the sample or introduced extraneous variables, such as; stage of illness, duration of illness and conventional or other treatments[<CitationRef CitationID="CR61">61</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR67">67</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR72">72</CitationRef>]. Studies using the SBM did not always explain the recursive nature of the factors which has recently been described[<CitationRef CitationID="CR50">50</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>Although some studies were based on large, nationally representative samples, some used small, potentially underpowered samples[<CitationRef CitationID="CR58">58</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR59">59</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR62">62</CitationRef>]. Two studies additionally only included CAM users, preventing comparison of CAM users and non users[<CitationRef CitationID="CR58">58</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR75">75</CitationRef>]. Although most studies did not specifically exclude non CAM users, there may have been response bias in terms of CAM users being more likely to take part.</Para>
                <Para>A number of studies used non validated measures, which limited the validity of the study and also makes comparison between different studies difficult. In particular a number of the studies based on the SBM used non validated measures of health beliefs [<CitationRef CitationID="CR65">65</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR66">66</CitationRef>], or did not include health beliefs at all[<CitationRef CitationID="CR68">68</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR69">69</CitationRef>].

Some studies investigated psychological constructs such as beliefs, using validated measures, but refrained from going further to consolidate a model.

                <Heading>CAM definition</Heading>
                <Para>In the studies included in this review not all studies made the distinction between different types of CAM therapies. Hendrickson et al highlight the problem of treating CAM as one modality and illustrate through their study that there are differences in the determinants of use of different type of CAM therapies[<CitationRef CitationID="CR68">68</CitationRef>]. Most studies included only practitioner based therapies, others viewed CAM in terms of the behaviour. The lack of a consistent operational definition of CAM use made the papers heterogeneous and difficult to combine and form conclusions and may explain some of the inconsistent findings in the literature. There is a need to examine studies which identify types of CAM in order to compare their findings, reflected in Andersen's suggestion that the outcome of the SBM should ideally relate to a specific type of healthcare service[<CitationRef CitationID="CR50">50</CitationRef>]. In addition, a distinction between CAM use as a treat, a preventative strategy or treatment of disease was often lacking; This may serve to distinguish between diverse CAM users who have different motivations for using such services[<CitationRef CitationID="CR66">66</CitationRef>] In addition other factors influencing the status of CAM which may affect the decision making process will vary between, and even within, countries of study. These include professional regulation, legal status, financial access and reimbursement of CAM and its integration within national health systems.</Para>

                <Heading>Healthcare utilisation models</Heading>
                <Para>The socio-behavioural model was the most commonly used, and was largely supported for modelling CAM decision making, although some studies were only partially supportive of the model; most commonly enabling factors were not significant. One study[<CitationRef CitationID="CR69">69</CitationRef>] was based on an adapted SBM model, the "CAM Healthcare Model"[<CitationRef CitationID="CR83">83</CitationRef>]. Here the SBM was extended to examine the concurrent, complementary use of conventional medicine and CAM, and the choice between them, and included self-care practices and products as well as practitioner based CAM[<CitationRef CitationID="CR83">83</CitationRef>]. The only study using the SBM for child CAM use added the component of healthcare experience[<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>]. These adaptations may be important for child use of CAM which is often non practitioner based (88% of CAM use by London paediatric outpatients[<CitationRef CitationID="CR84">84</CitationRef>] and 64% in the USA was non practitioner based[<CitationRef CitationID="CR85">85</CitationRef>]), and parental use of CAM is very likely to influence child use[<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR40">40</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR86">86</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR87">87</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>The findings from the studies using the SBM are summarised in Figure <InternalRef RefID="Fig2">2</InternalRef>. As described by Andersen[<CitationRef CitationID="CR50">50</CitationRef>], the importance of health beliefs and organisational (enabling) factors may be underestimated due to the inadequate conceptualisation (and therefore measurement) of these in many studies. Findings have supported Andersen's claim that need factors are important, but it should be emphasised that these factors are heavily dependent on social context and health beliefs[<CitationRef CitationID="CR50">50</CitationRef>].<Figure Category="Standard" Float="Yes" ID="Fig2">

</Para>
                <Para>This review only identified one study using a theoretical model for child use of CAM. Although this study found support for most components of the SBM, this study was based in the USA, only tested practitioner based CAM, and the survey was not specifically designed to test the SBM. The lack of studies on child use of CAM using a theoretical model means this review is unable to extrapolate findings to the use of CAM in children. However it does highlight the need to identify the most suitable model and to test it's suitability for application to CAM use both for parents and children to determine whether the processes are similar to the choices of CAM in adults. The original SBM used the family as the unit of study[<CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>], and although recently this has changed to the individual, due to problems in measuring family based variables[<CitationRef CitationID="CR50">50</CitationRef>], the family focus is especially appropriate for child CAM use.</Para>
                <Para>One of the main strengths of the SBM is that it incorporates variables which may include both subjective (e.g. health beliefs, perception of illness) and objective (e.g. income, symptoms) variables from a variety of domains – socioeconomic, biological, psychological and social. As such this model fits very comfortably with an interdisciplinary and integrative view of healthcare utilisation, whist taking account of idiosyncratic influences as well.</Para>
                <Para>However, the SBM falls short of naming the specific processes which are often complicated and non-linear, which lead to the specific decisions to use CAM among individuals and subgroups[<CitationRef CitationID="CR44">44</CitationRef>]. Also, qualitative studies [<CitationRef CitationID="CR73">73</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR77">77</CitationRef>] highlighted the importance of temporal factors, e.g. deciding to use CAM through continuous appraisal of well-being and due to perception of circumstances at that point, which SBM fails to account for. While the model succeeds in incorporating health beliefs within the predisposing factors, which in turn encompass other affective and cognitive factors, specific health beliefs are often not identified. Empirical study using the SBM needs to ensure that the findings are integrated back into the model and not left as a collection of associations. To this end, it is recommended that future studies utilise a longitudinal prospective approach, whilst ensuring differentiation between different CAM modalities.</Para>
                <Para>The Consumer Decision-Making model[<CitationRef CitationID="CR51">51</CitationRef>] was able to take into account the variability in the decision factors and the intricacy of their relationships and effects on each other. However, it is not specifically related to health and does not include factors relating to emotional and interactive aspects of care which may be important for both CAM use and child healthcare. The Consumer Decision Making model contained no integration of affective or value-laden factors which would differentiate individuals with similar experience from one another[<CitationRef CitationID="CR44">44</CitationRef>].</Para>

                <Heading>Health behaviour models</Heading>
                <Para>When CAM use is viewed as a health behaviour, individual differences which are not explainable in terms of more extrinsic characteristics (e.g. socio-demographic) can be explained. This is important given that CAM use is often a behaviour specific to an individual[<CitationRef CitationID="CR77">77</CitationRef>]. The advantages of this approach are two-fold; Firstly psychological factors, such as cognition, beliefs and values, are considered to be important and proximal to the decision to carry out certain behaviour, and may mediate other more extrinsic factors[<CitationRef CitationID="CR88">88</CitationRef>]. Secondly, psychological factors, as opposed to extrinsic factors, have the advantage of being amenable to change, at least to some extent; this is particularly important in relation to health-related interventions including CAM[<CitationRef CitationID="CR88">88</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>The health locus of control was predictive of CAM use in two studies[<CitationRef CitationID="CR59">59</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR61">61</CitationRef>] but not in three[<CitationRef CitationID="CR58">58</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR60">60</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR62">62</CitationRef>]. In addition, many of the HLoC studies were carried out on samples of patients with a chronic illness, so of limited generalisability. In terms of the decision to use CAM, it can relate to the perception of control over illness and treatment.</Para>
                <Para>TTM and TPB were found to be supportive of CAM use prediction and psychological factors were more important than medical or demographic, but only when the two models were used together, and findings may be open to selection bias[<CitationRef CitationID="CR63">63</CitationRef>]. Both beliefs about the positive effects and worries about the negative effects were important[<CitationRef CitationID="CR63">63</CitationRef>]. Family expectation was particularly important in the TPB[<CitationRef CitationID="CR63">63</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>The self-regulatory model received little support for predicting CAM use[<CitationRef CitationID="CR70">70</CitationRef>]. People may pursue a particular treatment if they perceive their illness in a certain way or hold particular treatment beliefs, for example having a holistic approach to health and illness being the strongest predictor of CAM use[<CitationRef CitationID="CR89">89</CitationRef>]. Braden's self help model had strong support as patients used CAM because it was perceived as effective and was related to income, however it was only tested by one study of cancer patients[<CitationRef CitationID="CR72">72</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>The Health Locus of Control, Self-Regulatory model, TPB and TTM all had the weakness that they tended to originate from a singular viewpoint which results in limited integration of the sources of influence, and thus they were able to account for limited variability in the dependent variable.</Para>
                <Para>The models developed using qualitative data may prove useful once empirically tested, although these were all based on patients with chronic health problems[<CitationRef CitationID="CR71">71</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR75">75</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR77">77</CitationRef>].</Para>

                <Heading>Limitations of review</Heading>
                <Para>Due to disparate terms used in the decision making literature, it was difficult to define search terms to capture all relevant papers. Although searches were kept broad with extensive hand searching of reference lists to capture a wide range of articles, the search terms could have included terms such as 'Framework', although subsequent scanning of results it did not seem to make a difference to the papers chosen for inclusion. Language bias may well be an issue as only English language papers were chosen (15 were excluded for this reason) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR90">90</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>The review only included published papers, which did not capture potentially important sources of information such as theses, conferences abstracts and official reports. In addition papers on this subject were published in journals in a very wide range of subject areas; there may be other databases which should have been included. The review only included studies published post 1994 which may have been a source of bias.</Para>
                <Para>Terms for CAM could have been expanded to include all CAM modalities (e.g. acupuncture, herbal etc), in order to capture studies that may not be indexed under general CAM terms.</Para>

                <Heading>Future research</Heading>
                <Para>The review found that the SBM has strong support for modelling the decision making process in CAM use. However, a number of methodological limitations were identified which future research needs to address. The decision making process appears to vary depending on the CAM modality; comparison between CAM modalities should be made. Extraneous variables should be controlled for, especially illness characteristics. Quantitative studies should include sufficiently powered samples, validated measures and multivariate analysis. Studies of the SBM should also incorporate the dynamic, interactive nature of the factors in the model.</Para>
                <Para>The use of qualitative methods to explore decision making is particularly interesting and should be considered carefully. The discipline of psychology is particularly prone to quantitative methods, except when the subject of study is exploratory. This issue may represent a disadvantage in applying psychological approaches to the data as many pertinent findings which arise from qualitative studies are often omitted from subject analysis as they do not fit easily into pre-set conceptual categories. As child use of CAM was identified as an underexplored area, the use of qualitative methodology to examine the predictors and correlates of CAM use would be particularly relevant for child use of CAM.</Para>
                <Para>Some of the authors are now engaged in a funded research project using qualitative methods to clarify validity and to identify the relative importance of the factors and will test this using a quantitative questionnaire using correlational and regression analysis to validate the model.</Para>

              <Heading>Conclusion</Heading>
              <Para>Andersen's sociobehavioural model has been identified as a suitable model for modelling the decision making process resulting in adult CAM use. However, the suitability of application of this model to child CAM use has not fully been studied and needs further clarification. This identification of a suitable decision making model is facilitating theory-guided research into how and why CAM is used for children, through empirical testing. Using an existing model promotes methodological consistency, which is imperative in the field of CAM which often uses disparate methods and tools. Providing an overarching model which has been tested for a child population will aid to guide healthcare practitioners' understanding and application to clinical practice[<CitationRef CitationID="CR91">91</CitationRef>].</Para>

                <Para>Biomedical research constantly produces new findings but these are not routinely translated into health care practice. One way to address this problem is to develop effective interventions to translate research findings into practice. Currently a range of empirical interventions are available and systematic reviews of these have demonstrated that there is no single best intervention. This evidence base is difficult to use in routine settings because it cannot identify which intervention is most likely to be effective (or cost effective) in a particular situation. We need to establish a scientific rationale for interventions. As clinical practice is a form of human behaviour, theories of human behaviour that have proved useful in other similar settings may provide a basis for developing a scientific rationale for the choice of interventions to translate research findings into clinical practice.</Para>
                <Para>The objectives of the study are: to amplify and populate scientifically validated theories of behaviour with evidence from the experience of health professionals; to use this as a basis for developing predictive questionnaires using replicable methods; to identify which elements of the questionnaire (i.e., which theoretical constructs) predict clinical practice and distinguish between evidence compliant and non-compliant practice; and on the basis of these results, to identify variables (based on theoretical constructs) that might be prime targets for behaviour change interventions.</Para>

                <Para>We will develop postal questionnaires measuring two motivational, three action and one stage theory to explore five behaviours with 800 general medical and 600 general dental practitioners. We will collect data on performance for each of the behaviours. The relationships between predictor variables (theoretical constructs) and outcome measures (data on performance) in each survey will be assessed using multiple regression analysis and structural equation modelling. In the final phase of the project, the findings from all surveys will be analysed simultaneously adopting a random effects approach to investigate whether the relationships between predictor variables and outcome measures are modified by behaviour, professional group or geographical location.</Para>

              <Heading>Background</Heading>
              <Para>Clinical and health services research is continually producing new findings that may contribute to effective and efficient patient care. However, despite the considerable resources devoted to biomedical science, a consistent finding from the literature is that the transfer of research findings into practice is a slow and haphazard process. Reports of inappropriate care abound across different healthcare settings, countries and specialties. In the UK, these include: primary medical care, e.g. the management of hypertension [<CitationRef CitationID="CR1">1</CitationRef>]; the administration of secondary prophylactic drugs to patients surviving a myocardial infarction [<CitationRef CitationID="CR2">2</CitationRef>]; primary dental care, e.g., selection criteria for dental radiography [<CitationRef CitationID="CR3">3</CitationRef>]; and secondary care, e.g. the administration of thrombolysis to patients thought to have suffered a myocardial infarction [<CitationRef CitationID="CR4">4</CitationRef>]; the administration of secondary prophylactic drugs to patients surviving a myocardial infarction [<CitationRef CitationID="CR5">5</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Para>The recognition of the failure to translate research findings into practice has led the UK government to propose the introduction of clinical governance [<CitationRef CitationID="CR6">6</CitationRef>] to '<Emphasis Type="Italic">assure and improve clinical standards throughout the NHS. This includes action to ensure risks are avoided, adverse events are rapidly detected, openly investigated and lessons learned, good practice is rapidly disseminated and systems are in place to ensure continuous improvements in clinical care</Emphasis>'. Active dissemination and implementation strategies to promote evidence-based health care will be needed to achieve the clinical effectiveness element of clinical governance if it is to achieve its potential [<CitationRef CitationID="CR7">7</CitationRef>].</Para>
              <Section2 ID="Sec2">
                <Heading>Implementation research</Heading>
                <Para>Implementation research is the scientific study of methods to promote the uptake of research findings, and hence to reduce inappropriate care. It includes the study of influences on healthcare professionals' behaviour and interventions to enable them to use research findings more effectively. Over the past five years a considerable body of implementation research has developed [<CitationRef CitationID="CR8">8</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR9">9</CitationRef>]. This research demonstrates that multifaceted complex interventions can be effective, but provides little information to guide the choice, or optimise the components, of such complex interventions in practice. The UK Medical Research Council recently proposed a framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions such as implementation strategies [<CitationRef CitationID="CR10">10</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>This recognised the need to establish the theoretical bases of interventions and undertake exploratory studies to choose and refine interventions. This would optimise interventions to be evaluated in definitive trials and increase understanding of the generalisability of the findings of such studies. The value of such a framework can be illustrated by the development of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), a complex and effective set of interventions that is now widely used in clinical practice to treat psychological problems such as chronic anxiety or phobia [<CitationRef CitationID="CR11">11</CitationRef>]. CBT developed from learning theories originating in the early twentieth century [<CitationRef CitationID="CR12">12</CitationRef>]. It was modelled and refined in analogue studies and exploratory trials in the 1960s (e.g., [<CitationRef CitationID="CR13">13</CitationRef>]); with definitive randomised controlled trials being conducted in the 1970s (e.g., [<CitationRef CitationID="CR14">14</CitationRef>]) and long term implementation studies conducted over the last twenty years [<CitationRef CitationID="CR15">15</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR16">16</CitationRef>]. We now need to apply a similar framework in implementation research.</Para>
                <Para>In order to minimise the number of costly 'real world' pragmatic implementation trials that need to be conducted, it is necessary to identify the 'active ingredients' in professional behaviour change. Interventions could be effective for two reasons: they may contain components that effectively overcome the specific barriers encountered in relation to a particular practice; or they may contain components that are always effective in changing practice. Hence, two approaches are necessary to identify the 'active ingredients' in implementation interventions. One is to develop an understanding of the factors underlying clinical practice, in order to identify what sorts of processes should be targeted in implementation interventions (process modelling). The other is to develop an understanding of how the interventions themselves work. This study is concerned with process modelling.</Para>
                <Para>The overall aim of process modelling in implementation research is to explore relevant theory to ensure the best choice of interventions to optimise clinical practice. Ferlie and Shortell [<CitationRef CitationID="CR17">17</CitationRef>] have suggested four levels at which interventions to improve the quality of health care might operate: the individual health professional; health care groups or teams; organisations providing health care (e.g., NHS trusts); and the larger health care system or environment in which individual organizations are embedded. Different types of theory will be relevant to interventions at different levels, for example, psychological theories will be more relevant to interventions directed at individuals and teams, theories of organisational change will be more relevant to interventions directed at hospitals or trusts, and so on. A full scientific rationale for interventions to translate research findings into clinical practice requires exploration of theories relevant to each of these four levels. This study focuses on the individual health professional level and investigates psychological theories to explore factors that are associated with adherence to evidence-based health care. We have chosen to start this work at the individual level and using psychological theories for the following reasons.</Para>
                <Para>Eighty percent of existing interventions used in implementation research focus on the individual practitioner (e.g., continuing medical education, educational outreach, audit and feedback, reminders) [<CitationRef CitationID="CR18">18</CitationRef>]. To date the research evaluating these interventions has been empirically driven and a scientific rationale for the choice of interventions has not been developed. Evaluations of interventions at the organisational level are relatively rare in comparison. A wide range of factors influence health care delivery, however, most theories of organisational change propose that their effects on clinical practice are mediated through the actions of individual practitioners [<CitationRef CitationID="CR19">19</CitationRef>]. Ultimately, it is the individual clinician who decides whether or not to prescribe an antibiotic for a particular patient. This application includes psychological theories that propose that the professional's perception of factors, such as resource constraints or organisational policy, are key determinants of their actions.</Para>
                <Para>Patient preferences, patient views and the dynamics of the professional-patient consultation are important factors in health care delivery. The theories included in this application will allow us to measure the effects of the health care professional's perception of these factors on their practice. For example, our previous work using one of the theories has found that some GPs are more likely to prescribe an antibiotic if a patient specifically asks for one [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>]. The problem of understanding why health professionals do or do not implement research findings is similar to finding out why people do or do not adopt a healthy lifestyle. This is an area which has been extensively investigated, and in which psychological theories have already demonstrated their value.</Para>

</Para>
                <Para>Motivational theories propose that motivation determines behaviour, and therefore the best predictors of behaviour are factors that predict or determine motivation (or intention). Action theories may include motivational elements, but postulate that other factors are necessary to predict behaviour. Stage theories propose that individuals are at different stages in the progress toward behaviour change (for example, a motivated stage is likely to occur before an action stage), and that predictors of behaviour may be different for individuals at different stages. In this study we will test the predictive power of theoretical constructs drawn from two motivational theories (social cognitive theory and the theory of planned behaviour), three action theories (operant conditioning, implementation intentions and Leventhal's self-regulation model of illness cognitions) and a stage theory approach (adapted from the transtheoretical model of behaviour change and the precaution adoption process model).</Para>

                  <Para>Bandura's social cognitive theory [<CitationRef CitationID="CR22">22</CitationRef>] proposes that behaviour is determined by incentives (see operant conditioning below) and expectancies. Three kinds of expectancies are described in the theory: situation outcome expectancies, outcome expectancies and self-efficacy expectancies. Situation-outcome expectancies are beliefs about how events are connected (e.g., smoking is bad for your health). Outcome expectancies refer to beliefs about the consequences of performing a behaviour (e.g., if I stop smoking, I will put on weight). Self efficacy expectancies are beliefs about one's ability to perform the behaviour (e.g., I can stop smoking). All of these are seen to be important in health behaviours, but self-efficacy expectancies have been found to be the most important in empirical studies [<CitationRef CitationID="CR23">23</CitationRef>]. It has been successfully applied to a wide range of health behaviours, and is one of the most powerful and consistent predictors [<CitationRef CitationID="CR24">24</CitationRef>]. For this reason, we will include the self-efficacy construct as a predictor variable.</Para>

                  <Heading>Motivational theories: the theory of planned behaviour</Heading>
                  <Para>The theory of planned behaviour [<CitationRef CitationID="CR25">25</CitationRef>] proposes that the strength of an individual's intention (or motivation) to engage in a behaviour, and the degree of control they feel they have over that behaviour (perceived behavioural control) are the proximal determinants of engaging in it. The perceived behavioural control construct in the theory of planned behaviour is closely related to (and originates from) the concept of self-efficacy in social cognitive theory. Recent studies have suggested that it is a broader construct, however, and is a proxy measure of the degree of actual control that people have over their behaviour as well as their confidence in performing it [<CitationRef CitationID="CR26">26</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR27">27</CitationRef>]. The theory of planned behaviour also includes propositions about the determinants of intention strength. It proposes that intention strength is determined by three variables: attitudes towards the behaviour, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control over it. These variables in turn are based upon salient beliefs about the behaviour.</Para>
                  <Para>Attitudes towards the behaviour are proposed to arise from a combination of beliefs about its consequences (behavioural beliefs – conceptually similar to outcome expectancies in social cognitive theory) and evaluations of those consequences (outcome evaluations). Subjective norms are based on perceptions of the views of other individuals or groups (normative beliefs), and the strength of the individual's desire to gain approval of these groups (motivation to comply). Influential people might include members of the clinical team, senior staff, patients, managers and professional organisations. Perceived behavioural control is a function of beliefs about factors likely to facilitate or inhibit the behaviour (control beliefs). These might include organisational constraints and patient preferences. This theory also proposes that attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control have determinants. The attitude component is a function of people's beliefs about the outcome of the behaviour combined with their evaluation of these outcomes (similar to outcome expectancies in social cognitive theory). The subjective norm component is a function of beliefs about the preferences of other salient groups or individuals, multiplied by the person's motivation to comply with this reference group. Perceived behavioural control is determined by beliefs about the potential barriers and facilitators to performing the behaviour, multiplied by the perceived power of these factors to inhibit or facilitate the behaviour. It is by measuring these beliefs that the theory of planned behaviour becomes sensitive to factors such as patient preferences or resource constraints on health professional practice. The four proximal determinants of behaviour from the theory of planned behaviour will be included as theoretical constructs (i.e., behavioural intention, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control). Determinants of attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control will also be measured. These will only be included as predictor variables for the behavioural outcomes in the final analysis however if preliminary analysis shows that their effects on behavioural intention are not mediated by attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control respectively.</Para>

                  <Heading>Action theories: operant conditioning</Heading>
                  <Para>Operant conditioning proposes that behaviours that have perceived positive consequences for the individual (such as remuneration) are likely to be repeated, whereas those that have perceived unpleasant consequences will become less frequent [<CitationRef CitationID="CR28">28</CitationRef>]. This is equivalent to the concept of incentives in social cognitive theory. An incentive is a perceived positive consequence of a behaviour. It can take a variety of forms, from material incentives (e.g., financial rewards), through social incentives (e.g., maintaining a positive relationship) to personal incentives (e.g., achieving a desired goal). The principle that positive consequences promote repetition of behaviour is well established and has been widely and successfully used to understand behaviour and behaviour change [<CitationRef CitationID="CR29">29</CitationRef>]. As rewarded behaviours are repeated, and may become 'habitual', the frequency of past behaviour can be a powerful predictor of future behaviour [<CitationRef CitationID="CR30">30</CitationRef>]. We will include two theoretical constructs derived from operant conditioning theory: perceived consequences of behaviour and frequency of behaviour in the past.</Para>

                  <Para>Gollwitzer [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>] has made the distinction between goal intentions' and 'implementation intentions'. A goal intention is an intention to perform a behaviour or achieve a goal (e.g., I intend to reduce the number of referrals I make for lumbar spine x-rays). This is conceptually close to the behavioural intention construct in the theory of planned behaviour. By contrast, 'implementation intentions' are explicit plans about when and where a goal intention will be achieved [<CitationRef CitationID="CR31">31</CitationRef>]. Gollwitzer argues that by creating an implementation intention, people effectively transfer control of the behaviour to the environment – establishing cues to action. For example, by saying that 'When a patient tells me about their low back pain, I will explain the pros and cons of an x-ray to them'. This is a relatively new concept in health behaviour research, however experimental studies suggest that people who have formulated plans like these are more likely to translate their intentions into action than those who have not [<CitationRef CitationID="CR32">32</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR33">33</CitationRef>]. The extent of prior planning will be included as a theoretical construct.</Para>

                  <Para>In addition to plans and behavioural consequences, it seems likely that the actions that health professionals take may be influenced by their views and feelings about the particular condition that a patient has presented with. Leventhal's self-regulatory model [<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>] proposes that individuals attempt to make sense of illness by making use of pre-existing knowledge or schemas (cognitive representations), and that these give rise to behavioural responses. For patients, behavioural responses may include going to see a doctor, taking prescribed or non prescribed medicines, participating in rehabilitation programmes etc. For clinicians, responses may include referring a patient for diagnostic tests, prescribing a drug, restoring a carious tooth etc. The model is described as self-regulatory because this is seen as a dynamic process. The aim of the actions that people take is to restore their own (or their patient's) physical or emotional equilibrium. Individuals monitor the success of the strategies they have adopted to cope with the health threat, and persist with those that enable them to solve the problem of what is happening to their health [<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>]. Such representations have been shown to influence the behaviour of patients, e.g., coping with everyday living [<CitationRef CitationID="CR35">35</CitationRef>], taking prescribed medication [<CitationRef CitationID="CR36">36</CitationRef>] and attending cardiac rehabilitation programmes [<CitationRef CitationID="CR37">37</CitationRef>]. In the proposed project we will investigate whether the cognitive representations that health professionals hold of particular conditions and their emotional reactions to them influence the care that they provide. As far as we are aware, the theory has not been used in this way before.</Para>
                  <Para>The individual's own understanding (cognitive representation) of their situation is central to the self-regulatory approach. Leventhal and his colleagues have shown that in relation to illness, this representation has five clear components: these are the perceived identity, cause, controllability, duration and consequences of the condition [<CitationRef CitationID="CR34">34</CitationRef>]. These influence how the individual responds to the problem. In addition to coping with their beliefs about the illness, the self-regulatory theory proposes that people actively try to cope with the emotions that are associated with the illness (e.g., fear or distress). These coping responses are also behavioural, and can include a wide range of activities, from information seeking to smoking. It seems likely that health professionals also experience emotional reactions to some conditions or patient groups, for example the emotional reaction to 'heartsink' patients, which may influence their practice. Hence, we will include six theoretical constructs from self-regulatory theory: perceived identity, cause, controllability, duration and consequences of the condition, and emotional reaction to the condition.</Para>

                  <Heading>Stage theories</Heading>
                  <Para>Stage theories propose that behaviour change occurs in a stepwise process, rather than a linear fashion as implied by motivational or action theories. From a stage theory perspective, interventions to facilitate change will be most effective if they are tailored to the stage an individual has reached within this process. Stage theories have been used widely to develop interventions to facilitate changes in behaviours such as smoking cessation (e.g. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR38">38</CitationRef>]). While there are differences between the stage models in the number and nature of stages proposed, stage theories typically distinguish motivation and action steps [<CitationRef CitationID="CR39">39</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR41">41</CitationRef>]. Empirical studies of general population groups have demonstrated that linear or simple two-stage theories (motivation and action) can be as useful as more complex five or seven stage theories for some health-related behaviours [<CitationRef CitationID="CR42">42</CitationRef>] and Weinstein et al have demonstrated that different factors influence behaviour at these two stages [<CitationRef CitationID="CR43">43</CitationRef>]. Further, in the Precaution Adoption Process model, Weinstein has proposed an additional early stage when individuals may be unaware of the need for behaviour change, a stage which may have particular relevance to the early stages of the implementation of evidence [<CitationRef CitationID="CR40">40</CitationRef>]. We propose to investigate a four stage model (unaware, unmotivated, motivated but not acting, and taking action) which will be compared with linear theories in order to identify which provides the best rationale for the choice of interventions to change practice.</Para>

                <Heading>Work leading up to this study</Heading>
                <Para>The authors have conducted several exploratory studies to investigate the feasibility of using psychological theories in implementation research, and their ability to identify variables that might be prime targets for interventions [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR44">44</CitationRef>–<CitationRef CitationID="CR46">46</CitationRef>]. For example, two recent studies have used the theory of planned behaviour to investigate factors associated with prescribing antibiotics for patients with a sore throat amongst general medical practitioners [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>], and to investigate the effect of interventions to implement guidelines for the management of third molars among general dental practitioners across Scotland [<CitationRef CitationID="CR45">45</CitationRef>]. In both studies, preliminary interviews were used to develop questionnaires following standard procedures for studies using the theory of planned behaviour [<CitationRef CitationID="CR47">47</CitationRef>].</Para>
                <Para>In the antibiotics and sore throats study, a postal questionnaire was distributed to a 1 in 2 random sample of GPs in the region, achieving a 70% response rate. Using the theory, hypotheses were tested about the relationships between GPs' perceptions and the strength of their intention to prescribe antibiotics. This allowed us to do three things. The first was to identify whether GPs intended to prescribe antibiotics or not. The second was to estimate the overall impact of individual beliefs and perceptions on the strength of their motivation to prescribe; in this study, the multiple correlation coefficient between intention to prescribe and the beliefs and perceptions of individual GPs was 0.69. The third was to identify which beliefs had the biggest impact on motivation. From this, we have made clear predictions about the factors that are likely to increase motivation to reduce prescribing.</Para>
                <Para>The third molar study is a randomised controlled trial, using a 2 × 2 factorial design, in which general dental practitioners are randomly allocated to receive audit and feedback or not, and to be given computer-assisted learning or not, following the introduction of guidelines for the management of third molars. A postal questionnaire measuring constructs from the theory of planned behaviour and knowledge of third molar management was distributed to all the participating dentists after the interventions, achieving a response rate of 90%. This has shown that the interventions have different effects on the theoretical constructs. Both of the interventions affected the dentists' intention to follow the guidelines. In addition, computer assisted learning increased their confidence in their ability to put the research evidence into practice (perceived behavioural control), while audit and feedback increased their knowledge of the research evidence. The theory of planned behaviour proposes that changes in practice should follow from effects on perceived behavioural control and intention, but not from effects on knowledge. So, we would expect computer assisted learning should be more effective in this setting than audit and feedback. However we are still collecting the clinical practice outcome data to investigate this.</Para>

Four surveys will be focus on general medical practice (two in England and two in Scotland), while three will focus on general dental practice.

We have chosen two professional groups working in similar but unrelated primary care settings in order to test the possibility that unchangeable organisational or individual factors moderate the relationship between the included variables and clinical practice. To examine the potential effects of variations in the organisation of primary health care, we will compare GPs practicing in Scotland and the north of England.</Para>

                  <Para>Rationale: Lumbar spine x-rays are of limited diagnostic benefit within primary care settings and are associated with significant ionising radiation dosage [<CitationRef CitationID="CR50">50</CitationRef>]. Despite this lumbar spine x-rays are the fourth commonest x-ray request from primary care doctors [<CitationRef CitationID="CR51">51</CitationRef>] with referrals continuing at the rate of 7 patients per 1000 patients mean list size per year [<CitationRef CitationID="CR52">52</CitationRef>]. We have recently completed a trial that found that appropriate indications for referral were not identifiable by case note review for the majority of GP requests [<CitationRef CitationID="CR52">52</CitationRef>]. The trial also observed a reduction in lumbar spine x-rays of 20% without apparent adverse effects following the introduction of educational messages [<CitationRef CitationID="CR52">52</CitationRef>].</Para>

In addition we will only use departments that have a computerised information system storing details of requesting general practitioner and type of x-ray. After obtaining consent from the study practitioners, we will ask the radiology departments to provide data on lumbar spine x-ray requests for three months following the survey. We have successfully used this method in two different studies across six radiological departments [<CitationRef CitationID="CR51">51</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR52">52</CitationRef>].</Para>

Although modern intra-oral dental films are associated with very low doses of ionising radiation, the total national "volume" of radiographs taken is such that exposures are kept as low as is reasonably achievable. Within this context and that of the recently published Selection Criteria in Dental Radiography Guideline [<CitationRef CitationID="CR55">55</CitationRef>] however, comparison of data from the English and Scottish Dental Practice Boards [<CitationRef CitationID="CR56">56</CitationRef>] has shown that dentists in Scotland are taking fewer than optimal intra-oral radiographs.</Para>

Profiles show mean values of treatments per month for each dentist against averages for the local Health Board and Scotland as a whole. We will also collect appropriate personal data about the dentists and compare this with data from the recent national "Toothousand" census of General Dentists in Scotland.</Para>
                  <Para>The range of included activities will also allow us to explore contrasts between types of behaviour and professional groups. For example, the use of radiography is common in both general medical and dental practice. In addition we have chosen conditions that are clinically important in their own right, and for which evidence-based advice on best practice is available. In order to identify which variables (theoretical constructs) predict practice across these five tracer activities and to incorporate a geographical comparison in general medical practice seven surveys will be required. These will be of:</Para>

One is the extent to which people feel competent in general to control the behaviour in question). The other is the extent to which people feel competent to control their behaviour in specific situations.

The range of situations in which the tracer activity occurs, and characteristics of the situation that make the practitioner feel more or less able to control their behaviour will be elicited in the interviews. These interview responses will be used to generate situation specific self efficacy items using item types [<CitationRef CitationID="CR61">61</CitationRef>].</Para>

Each of these items will be measured on 7 point Likert type scales indicating degree of agreement with the item.

                  <Para>Measures will be developed for each predictor variable for each survey. We will use existing measures as a starting point in this process (wherever possible), and we will follow the standard procedures that have been described to develop measures of these theoretical constructs (e.g. [<CitationRef CitationID="CR66">66</CitationRef>]). Initially we will conduct semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 10–15 practitioners for each survey. The purpose of these interviews is to identify beliefs and attitudes relevant to the specific tracer activity and its associated health problem. The responses to these questions will be used to generate standard questionnaire items to assess the variables. Each questionnaire will then be piloted for clarity and acceptability to practitioners. The reliability of the measures will be assessed prior to analysis, using Cronbach's alpha to assess internal reliability and confirmatory factor analysis to identify and discard redundant items. The construct validity of the measures will be assessed prior to analysis by examining correlations between predictor variables that are expected to be similar (convergent validity) and dissimilar (discriminant validity). Measures which do not meet minimum criteria for reliability and validity (i.e., r &lt; 0.7) will not be entered into the analysis.</Para>

                <Para>The surveys will generate at least ordinal level quantitative data. The relationships between predictor and outcome measures in each survey will be assessed primarily using multiple regression analysis and structural equation modelling – a procedure that utilises the observed covariance matrix. Power calculations for multiple regression analysis depend on the number of cases per predictor variable. A minimum sample size of 50 + 8 m, where m is the number of predictor variables, is recommended for testing the multiple correlation, and 104 + m for testing individual predictors [<CitationRef CitationID="CR67">67</CitationRef>, <CitationRef CitationID="CR68">68</CitationRef>]. We have 14 predictor variables, requiring a minimum sample size of 162 per survey to test the multiple correlation, or 118 to test individual predictors. We will aim to achieve a final sample size of 200 respondents per survey (1400 respondents in total) to ensure that the sample size is sufficient to take the effects of covariates into account. Sample sizes for multiple regression can also be estimated using the change in R<Superscript>2</Superscript>. Using an R<Superscript>2</Superscript> of 48% (as found in our previous work on antibiotic prescribing among GPs [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>]), a study using 200 cases will have 90% power to detect a 3% increase in the R<Superscript>2</Superscript> at the 5% significance level for each additional covariate. Our proposed sample size of 1400 should ensure that the observed covariances are good estimates of the population covariance. An observed correlation of 0.5 will have a standard error of approximately 0.02.</Para>
                <Para>Two potential sources of response bias could apply in this study: non response to the questionnaire, and non consent to accessing behaviour data. Cummings et al [<CitationRef CitationID="CR69">69</CitationRef>] found an average response rate of 61% in a random sample of studies using surveys mailed to physicians. Recent studies that we have undertaken have suggested that we should achieve at least this response rate. The survey of GPs in Grampian used a questionnaire similar to those in this study, and achieved a response rate of 70% [<CitationRef CitationID="CR20">20</CitationRef>]. Assuming a conservative response rate of 60% and a total final sample size of 1400 (800 GPs and 600 dentists), we will distribute questionnaires to 334 practitioners per survey (1336 GPs and 1002 dentists). We do not know how many of these practitioners will agree to let us access personal performance data. Sensitivity analyses will be used to assess the possible bias due to non response and non consent.</Para>
                <Para>Logistic and linear multiple regression analysis will be used to assess the overall predictive power of the predictor variables (theoretical constructs) within each survey. Analyses will allow for the impact of two possible confounding variables: the number of patients that could potentially be seen by the GP or dentist (calculated as total practice size divided by the number of partners and adjusted to reflect full-time or part-time work); and the gender of the GP (a potential confound in the survey of norethisterone prescribing). In the final phase of the project, the findings from the seven surveys will be analysed simultaneously adopting a random effects approach [<CitationRef CitationID="CR70">70</CitationRef>] to investigate whether the relationships between predictor variables and outcome measures are modified by (a) professional group and (b) geographical location.</Para>
